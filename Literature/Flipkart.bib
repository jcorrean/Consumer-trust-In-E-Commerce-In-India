abstract={In the field of e-commerce applications, nowadays the aspect-based sentiment analysis has become vital and every consumer started focusing on various aspects of the product before making the purchase decision through online portals like Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba, Flipkart, etc. Hence, the enhancement of sentiment classification considering every aspect of product and services is in the limelight. In this proposed research, aspect-based sentiment classification model has been developed employing sentiment whale optimized adaptive neural network (SWOANN) for classifying the sentiment of key aspects of products and services. The proposed work uses the key features such as the positive opinion score, negative opinion score and the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) for representing each aspect of products and services, which further improves the overall effectiveness of the classifier. Moreover, the computational speed and accuracy of sentiment classification of the product and services have been improved by the optimal selection of weights of the neurons of proposed model. The promising results are obtained by analysing the mobile phone review dataset when compared with other existing sentiment classification approaches such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed model can be compatible with any sentiment classification problem of products and services. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Product classification is an essential first step in e-commerce starting from cataloging. It impacts various downstream processes such as: surfacing relevant attribute lists to capture product information, recommending right categories for sellers to list their product in(seller support), deciding on what quality control steps a product has to go through and so on. We identify the challenges involved in fashion product classification and show how dual-image based approach addresses them. We demonstrate this using large scale, real-world Fashion/Lifestyle data from Flipkart - India's largest e-commerce company. This dataset contains a mix of well known western concepts of fashion such as top, t-shirt, blazer and India specific fashion concepts such as sari, lehenga choli, kurta etc. We show that a dual-image based classifier gives 6% improvement in f1-score compared to a single-image based classifier. We show how this is helping sellers to list their products in Flipkart. Cataloging is the first step before selling the product online. Very first step in cataloging is to select appropriate product category. Flipkart, like all other e-commerce companies has its own categorisation of products which are known as verticals. A vertical construct is defined as a collection of attributes that define a product range. Eg. of verticals are ĝ t-shirt', ĝ watch', ĝ bag', etc. Since, there is no universal standard on how to group products into categories across various business avenues (both online and offline), the sellers get confused when selecting 'verticals' for a given product. We demonstrate the how dual image model product classification is used to address this problem. This system is in production and serving Flipkart sellers. It improved right first time (RFT) of listing by 2%. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

abstract={We present a demonstration of our English-to-Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi) product review translation system, ReviewMT1. The system is based on the neural machine translation (NMT) model which is used to translate the product reviews written by the users on the e-commerce platform, Flipkart. The objective of our translation system is to translate the user reviews, provide an interface to the translators/users to post-edit the output, rate the quality and to retrain the model from the corrected samples. The retraining using the post-edited samples provides better learning to the NMT model so that it does not repeat the same mistake during translation. ReviewMT also provides an additional functionality called sentiment-preserved machine translation' which preserves the sentiment of the source sentence into the target sentence during the translation. This is important as Machine Translation (MT) systems often fail to preserve different stylistic and pragmatic properties of the source text (e.g. sentiment, emotion, gender traits, etc.) to the target, especially in a low-resource scenario. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

abstract={In a (crisp) graph, set of all mutually non-adjacent vertices form an independent set. This set is more crucial in graph theory. The fuzzy graphs have broader aspects over crisp graphs in real world due to vagueness. Finding fuzzy independent sets in fuzzy graphs are one of the most needful tasks. In this paper, a new term “degree of independence” to a fuzzy graph is defined by considering the strength of edges incident to the vertices of that graph. It is noticed that several networking system such as placing mobile towers or placing facility centres of multinational companies like Amazon, Flipkart, eBay, Myntra, etc. demands to identify the nodes (towers, facility centres, etc. as the case may be) which are either not connected or weakly connected to each other to optimize the cost of services that they offer. These type of networking systems can be modelled as fuzzy graphs. Also, we have studied several graph products such as Cartesian product, tensor product, and normal product and computed their degree of independence. Here, we define (fuzzy) independent set in a new way. As per our definition, any set of vertices of a graph form an independent set with degree of independence. If the degree of independence is 1, then the set becomes conventional independent set. © 2022, The National Academy of Sciences, India.},

Behind this, so many reasons are available such as quality, quantity, price of the items, discount imposed upon them, etc. to drop items either from the cart or at any initial stage of purchasing. These dropped items, which are hesitated by customers are known as Hesitated Items or almost sold items and mining such items are referred to as Hesitation Mining. Furthermore, in order to discover the relation between purchased or sold items, an approach of data mining known to be association rule mining (ARM) is used. But association rule mining deals only with sold items and does not consider the almost sold items, in simple words this scenario tells that these almost sold items contain a piece of important information which is hesitation information and this traditional association rule mining ignores such type of information, which is also equally essential as frequently purchased items for the growth of an individual organization. Therefore, in order to extract this hesitation information and make selling strategies, an approach known as Vague Association Rule Mining is used. Thus, the main objective of this article is to give an overview of the hesitated items, uncertainty situations and mentions the issues, current trends, challenges, and futuristic vision pertaining to Hesitation Mining. Moreover, the author also mentions the researches done by many researchers in this field of Hesitation Mining. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose: To test if the factors “reviewer location” and “time frame” have any impact on the prediction results when predicting online product ratings from user reviews. Design/methodology/approach: Reviews and ratings are scraped for the product “The Secret” book through Web pages of e-commerce websites like Amazon and Flipkart. Such data is used for training the model to predict ratings of similar products based on reviews data in various other social media platforms like Facebook, Quora and YouTube. After data preprocessing, sentiment analysis is used for opinion classification. A multi-class supervised support vector machine is used for feature classification and predictions. The four models produced in the study have a prediction accuracy of 79%. The data collection is done based on a specific geographical location and specific time frame. Post evaluating the predictions, inferential statistics are used to check for significance. Findings: There will be an impact on the ratings predicted from the reviews that belong to a particular geographic location or time frame. The ratings predicted from such reviews help in taking accurate decisions as they are robust and informative. Research limitations/implications: This study is confined to a single product and for cross domain social media pages, only Facebook, YouTube and Quora data are considered. Practical implications: Provides credible ratings of a product/service on all cross domain social media pages making the initial screening process of purchase decisions better. Originality/value: Many studies explored the usefulness of reviews for rating prediction based on review nature. This study aims to identify the usefulness of reviews based on factors that would reduce uncertainty in the purchase process. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Social media is a platform in which user can create, share and exchange the knowledge/information. Social media marketing is to identify the different consumer's demands and engages them to create marketing resources. The popular social media platforms are Microsoft, Snapchat, Amazon, Flipkart, Google, eBay, Instagram, Facebook, Pin interest, and Twitter. The main aim of social media marketing deals with various business partners and build good relationship with millions of customers by satisfying their needs. Disruptive technology is replacing old approaches in the social media marketing to new technology-based marketing. However, this disruptive technology creates some issues like fake news, insecure, inconsistency, inaccuracy and so on. These issues contribute economic instability in the society, diminishing the level of trustworthy. To overcome these issues, this paper we present blockchain as disruptive technology for social media marketing. Blockchain plays a vital role on social media marketing by providing secure to the company page in the website. The properties of disruptive potential of blockchain on social media marketing is transparency, security, reliability and immutability. This paper presents a new framework for disruptive technology in blockchain social media marketing using fusion of CryptoNight mining algorithm with YAC consensus algorithm [BCDSMM-CNYAC]. This mining algorithm provides high CPU efficiency, high dimensionality of secure and detecting falsifying data attack in the social media marketing. For the data analysis we proposedANOVAanalysismethod regarding to the factors of age, time, frequency visiting times of social media platform. For reliability analysis of data Cronbach's alpha tests are implemented. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Product categorization is a necessary feature of e-commerce websites since it ensures that the websites retrieve related items from the product taxonomy tree accurately. In traditional product categorization methods, machine learning and deep learning classification algorithms are frequently applied. These cater towards product categorization by taking input and then categorising it in one of the predefined categories. In this paper, we propose a machine translation-based solution for e-commerce product categorization. We convert the natural language description of a product into a token sequence that reflects the root leaf taxonomy of the product category. In the experiment, three e-commerce product datasets (Flipkart, Walmart, Amazon) have been combined to substantiate the applicability of the natural language models implemented. We demonstrate that ensembling sequence-to-sequence neural networks and the transformer model outperforms state-of-the-art product categorization algorithms in terms of predicted accuracy. In addition, the accuracy comparison for machine learning classification (KNN, Random Forests, SVM), deep learning classification (LSTM, BERT) and neural machine translation models (Seq2Seq, Seq2Seq + Transformer) is shown to validate ensembling the two elements as a better method. In conclusion, we illustrate that attentional sequential models generate product category labels without supervised constraints. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In the past few years, retail market industries have taken a broad form to sell the products online and also to give the opportunity to customers to provide their valuable feedbacks, suggestions and recommendations. The aim of this paper is to provide an automatic comment analyzer. And propose an automatic comment analyzer and classification system which can determine the polarity of the customer comments collected from Amazon and Flipkart data domains effectively. This system should be able to process the large number of reviews. It should categorize the comments as positive, negative and neutral classes using five prime supervised learning classifiers such as NB, LR, SentiWordNet, RF and KNN. The paper also discusses their experimental results and challenges found. Therefore, this study shows the maximum usage of feature extraction, positive–negative sentiment, Amazon web source, mobile phone for a large set of reviews in the existing algorithms. It included the preliminary definitions, information extraction and retrieval aspects, role of machine learning, and the comment mining. The comment analysis and classification described comment polarity, orientation, subjectivity detection, comment analysis, summarization and classification. The classification of comment analysis techniques explained various lexicons and supervised algorithms along with the essential used-based concerns. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Sentiment analysis refers to determining emotional content from a textual input. The Internet world is now run by the term “Web 2.0,” and one of the major platforms that made this web to web 2.0 is Twitter, a microblogging social network where one can post short messages known as tweets. The general public uses Twitter social networking platform very often to post opinions on various topics ranging from reviews to current affairs. And one of the trending topics in India in the year 2020 was the boycotting online shopping services such as Amazon and Flipkart due to issues related to political clash between India and China and also issues related to nepotism in Bollywood. The border issue between India and China was a big talking point as it involved clashes between the Chinese and Indian soldiers which resulted in few martyrs. This made a major public anger toward China and its products which then resulted into the boycott movement. The other talking point was the nepotism in Bollywood. The recent suicide of Sushant Singh Rajput has brought out the public sadness and blamed Bollywood nepotism as the result of his suicide. This resulted in public boycotting products that were endorsed by actors/actresses that were having a favoritism which was granted by their relatives in the Bollywood industry. Hence, we decided that it was a great opportunity to extract tweets related to this boycott movement and do sentiment analysis on it to determine various emotions expressed by the general public. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Starting with the deep learning architecture of Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS), we build upon and expand the model design and attention mechanisms to incorporate innovative approaches including multi-objective training, multi-pass training, and external rescoring using language models and phoneme based losses. We report a relative WER improvement of 15.7% on top of state-of-the-art LAS models using these modifications. Overall, we report an improvement of 36.9% over the phoneme-CTC system on the Flipkart Voice Search dataset. The paper also provides an overview of different components that can be tuned in a LAS based system. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={The sportswear industry has become prominent, popular, and a very obvious category among various age groups in India. Big sports brands like adidas, seeing the Indian market potential, have extended their businesses across the country. To increase sales, online purchase has become one the most effective, easy, cheap, and quickest solution for the end customers as it provides the end consumers a variety of products, their designs, and color combinations on clicks. A large number of consumers express what exactly the end customer thinks about a particular product's preference level of brand, quality of service, quality of product, or stylish nature of the product. The current study does an evaluation of such online comments and reviews giving their feedback on their public Twitter accounts, flipkart.com, or amazon.in about an adidas sports brand in India. The research also provides a basic flow of Java program in the form of an algorithm that is used to collect the dataset from Twitter, process it, and export it into an Excel sheet for further investigation.

abstract={Theoretical - Machine learning is the subset of manmade thinking that goes under data science. Without explicitly redid, getting PCs to learn is a science known as Machine Learning. The proposition systems present in the market are accepted to be working in mainstream applications like YouTube online media applications like Facebook, Instagram or thing based applications like Flipkart. Basically, these systems help to zero in on information that is concerned or important for a particular customer. One region where such structures can be particularly useful is contamination forewarning framework. Considering an ailment the customer commitments to the structure, that he thinks they are slanted to or they are encountering they will be proposed top 5 or top 3 afflictions they are for the most part slanted to reliant upon the similarity between the contamination customer inputted and the sickness customer is being recommended for the present circumstance being forewarned. As of now, everything is open on the web, every contamination and its information around there. Experts are there but simultaneously the count of ailments, number of patients for a disease are extending. An individual has one disorder then there are chances they will get another. Sickness incorporate among youths in this age bundle is growing at a gigantic rate. There is the fix of afflictions or conceivably not anyway shouldn't something be said about notice. If we alert someone before they are truly encountering a contamination. It will make him/her considerably more careful than beforehand. This paper examines existing recommender systems and besides includes the burdens of such structures. Drawbacks can be adaptability, cold start and sparsity. The proposed system partakes in its advantages anyway isn't yet available watching out. Assessment has been done on how this disease alerted system using content-based idea under AI is eliminating features from dataset and how this structure presents features like customer self-rule, straightforwardness and no infection start. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Today recommender system plays a very prominent role in suggesting and offering products to their customers on the basis of their interests and choices. We encounter these systems in our day to day life while interacting with several online based services. There are several models employed in various e-commerce based systems like amazon, flipkart etc. Our proposed architecture in this paper deploys a machine learning approach for item recommendation making use of collaborative based model. We are following the model based approach using the concept of singular value decomposition (SVD) for getting the ratings of unrated items and minimizing the sparsity problem. Our work also focus on calculating the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of our proposed system to check it's accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Given an edge-weighted graph and a subset of the vertices called terminals, the multiway cut problem aims to find a minimum weight set of edges that separates each terminal from all the others. This problem is known to be NP-hard even for k= 3. Computational experiments on social networks obtained from the Indian e-commerce company Flipkart show that an integer programming formulation (referred to as EF2) of the problem introduced by Chopra and Owen (1996) provides a very strong LP-relaxation that allows us to solve large problems in a reasonable amount of time. We show that the cardinality EF2 (where all edge weights are 1) on a wheel graph has a primal integer solution and a dual integer solution of the same value. We consider a hub-spoke network of wheel graphs constructed by adding edges connecting the hub vertices of a collection of wheel graphs. We assume that every wheel has a terminal hub or a terminal vertex with three non-terminal neighbors, and show that if the graph connecting the hub vertices is planar, the cardinality EF2 on the hub-spoke network of the wheel graphs has a primal integer solution and a dual integer solution of the same value. Given the prevalence of such structures in our social networks, our results provide some theoretical justification for the strong empirical performance of the EF2 formulation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Flipkart was launched in 2007 as an online platform for selling books by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal. Ten years later, the e-commerce company had 54 million active users and 100,000 plus sellers and had sold 261 million units. The founders had taken several steps to garner this growth, by making investments in technology, undertaking high-decibel advertising campaigns and promoting attractive offers on products sold on the platform. Despite the growth, the company was not making profits, and investors like Tiger Global were unhappy. Tiger Global Management brought in Kalyan Krishnamurthy to Flipkart in 2016, and a year later, Kalyan became the chief executive officer (CEO), replacing co-founder Binny who got promoted as group CEO. In May 2018, American retailer Walmart paid USD 16 billion to buy out Flipkart and in the same month, Sachin exited the venture by selling his shares for USD 1 billion. Seven months later, Binny was forced to resign on charges of personal misconduct. As these events unfolded, Flipkart was no longer the company founded by the Bansals. The case highlights critical issues in the Flipkart growth story and helps readers understand the nuances in managing stakeholders, including customers and investors. © 2021 Lahore University of Management Sciences.},

abstract={Cloud computing is one of the most growing technologies in recent technological developments. It offers many applications like it can store big data by taking no or little amount of cost. Cloud services offer Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Software as a service (SaaS) and Platform as a service (PaaS). Cloud computing is also used to take backup for data. Most of the big companies are now moving towards cloud services like google Facebook amazon Flipkart and many more. Day by day data size is being increased and charges are also increasing. Since cloud computing is best known technology it's more vulnerable to get attacked by attackers and data might be hacked or can be monitored or even can be altered over cloud space. This is the main reason why cloud companies need to take responsibility for our data. This is the main challenge for companies to make our data secured and safe over their data centers. This paper has proposed an enhanced hybrid ECC based encryption so that data is stored on the data center in encrypted form so that no one can understand the original content even though it gets monitored overcloud. This paper used CRT (Chinese remainder theorem) for generating a key for elliptical curve cryptography (ECC), and with ECC, this research work has proposed to add extra encryption with arithmetic encryption and after that, the data deduplication checking has been done by using cosine similarity so that no duplicated data is stored on the cloud. Finally, the advantages of our proposed system with known algorithms are discussed. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Usability Testing determines the friendliness of the application to meet customers' requirements. It must be adopted in the early stage of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) to avoid issues in a later stage. Today, E-commerce has revolutionized the mode of shopping, and thus, we need to focus on ways to improve the usability of e-commerce applications. We opted for survey questionnaires as our research methodology, along with testing websites using online tools based on the four parameters Connectivity, Readability, Accessibility, and Functional Performance. In the survey, the four most popular e-commerce applications were Amazon, Flipkart, Bigbasket, and Paytm. Out of which, Amazon was the most used e-commerce application by the consumers. Although, testing tools are depicted that applications need to improve in certain areas. From the analysis, we concluded that consumers are aware of the upcoming Jio-Mart, which can give tough competition to existing companies. Thus, all the existing e-commerce companies need to improve their web and mobile applications to retain their customer base. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={eCommerce Information Retrieval (IR) is receiving increasing attention in the academic literature and is an essential component of some of the world's largest web sites (e.g., Airbnb, Alibaba, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Flipkart, Lowe's, Taobao, and Target). SIGIR has for several years seen sponsorship from eCommerce organisations, reflecting the importance of IR research to them. The purpose of this workshop is (1) to bring together researchers and practitioners of eCommerce IR to discuss topics unique to it, (2) to determine how to use eCommerce's unique combination of free text, structured data, and customer behavioral data to improve search relevance, and (3) to examine how to build datasets and evaluate algorithms in this domain. Since eCommerce customers often do not know exactly what they want to buy (i.e. navigational and spearfishing queries are rare), recommendations are valuable for inspiration and serendipitous discovery as well as basket building. The theme of this year's eCommerce IR workshop is ensuring fairness in search and recommendations for eCommerce. The workshop includes papers on this topic as well as a panel focused on this area. In addition, Coveo is sponsoring an eCommerce data challenge on session-based prediction for predicting the next action with a special subtask on cart abandonment. The data challenge reflects themes from prior SIGIR workshops in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. © 2021 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Automatically extracting visual attributes for ecommerce data has widespread applications in cataloging, catalogue qualification and enrichment, visual search, etc. Here, we address the task of visual attribute extraction for a highly challenging real-world fashion data from Flipkart catalogue (an Indian e-commerce platform), which is collected from seller uploaded product images. This data not only contains widely varying categories (e.g., shirt, sari, shoes), but also has both coarse-grained (e.g., occasion, top type, sari type) and fine-grained (e.g., neck type, print type) attributes. Training examples available for different attributes are highly imbalanced, making this task even more challenging. To this end, we propose an end-to-end framework which integrates multi-task learning with transformer as an attention module, in addition to handling the data imbalance. The proposed architecture supports multiple attributes across various product categories in a scalable manner. Extensive experiments on the in-house dataset shows effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving performance of the fine-grained attributes by 13% on the baseline across the attributes. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={A data breach is a security event, where sensitive data is accessed without any permission from a website or an organization. An information breach will be considered as the purposeful or accidental gathering of secure or personal data from an organization. A breach can be an accession of a data without any permission, these kinds of regulations should be provided with safe and secured framework but this is not happening in many corporations. So, by analyzing the previous attempts (successful or unsuccessful attacks), the proposed model can be trained to adapt to new scenarios and predict the next breach. Further, this research work has designed a model by using machine learning to defend a website from security breaches. The primary aim of this research work is to create a machine learning model, which trains in Realtime and monitors the website or a system and trains from the state-of-art attacks. The proposed model has created a web application using Django, which takes the data from multiple sources such as Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, and Shop clues, which shows the data that is safe to obtain from the website. Then, the data will be sorted on our page and then it will be made secured and illegal for the external people to access the data from our website and the proposed model will monitor the website 24/7. The model is trained daily and it generates predictions from the several of datasets available and from the previous state-of-the-art attacks. This model will be trained from the existing datasets and the history of attacks and breaches on our website. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Software testing is vital for the intellectual benefits of software reliability and quality. At present, Graphical user interfaces are the most common and widely used interfaces in the software industry. Furthermore, GUI Testing is an important approach to ensure the quality of software. Automated software testing is a GUI front end applications similar to APP, and WEB, etc and is a vastly time and resource-consuming task. Therefore, this will become even more complex in rapidly updated GUI applications such as Ex: Patches/Version updates of a mobile App, or the product and offer updates in marketing websites like Flipkart, Amazon, etc., in which the GUI components are continuously updated infinitely. Developing a test case scenario whenever a new GUI component is updated will affect the productivity of the application. In our experiment, we found a better way of improving GUI testing by consequently detecting and classifying GUI widgets using machine learning techniques. Additionally, we also found that detecting and classifying GUI objects in screenshots and reports with a position of the widgets (x, y coordinates) and type of the widgets, matches with trained samples, URL links, and screen links. Hence, we in this paper will analyze and devise an efficient automated testing strategy for Web Applications. This is a unique way of web Graphical user interface testing with a computer vision. This paper will also present the parameters used for object detection, classification, and evaluation with image processing using machine learning algorithms with better accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={A price drop is a very common promotional tool used by brands and marketers to stimulate impulse buying as well as to improve stagnant sales. This study is primarily directed to study the effect of the price drop on the customer's perceived evaluation across selected product categories. For this study, the top three product categories based on the category wise sales data revealed by various online as well as offline shopping players during price drop sales have been selected, namely apparel, footwear, and electronics, as these product categories were most preferably shopped by customers and witnessed frequent price drop during festival seasons. For collecting data in National Capital Region (NCR), using purposive sampling 250 shoppers were surveyed who shopped for these product categories at Big Bazaar, Pantaloons, Spencer, Reliance trends, Amazon, Flipkart during discount days. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been run to identify the factors of customers’ perceived evaluation in case of a price drop. Further Multivariate Analysis Of Variance (MANOVA) has been used to check the effect of a price drop on identified perceived evaluation across selected product categories. This study explored that in case of price drop customers become concerned about the product quality, value, brand reputation, and innovativeness. Based on the mean value, the study found that customers were more concerned about perceived quality in case of price drop followed by perceived innovativeness, perceived value, and perceived brand reputation. The research further demonstrated that product categories were significantly related to perceived evaluators in case of a price drop. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Internet technology has occupied an important part of human lives. Users often face the problem of the available excessive information. Recommandation system (RS) are deployed to help users cope up with the information explosion. RS is mostly used in digital entertainment, such as Netflix, prime video, and IMDB, and e-commerce portals such as Amazon, Flipkart, and eBay. The two traditional methods namely, collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based approaches consist of few limitations individually. However, any hybrid system, which utilizes the advantage of both the systems to leverage better results. Some fundamental issues faced by movie recommendation systems such as scalability, cold start problem, data sparsity and practical usage feedback and verification based on real implementation are still neglected. Other issues that require significant research attention are accuracy and time complexity problem, which could make RS, a bad candidate for real-world recommendation systems. This literature survey aims to consolidate and structurally categorize all the major drawbacks present in the most common and popular commercial movie recommendation systems. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, researchers are focusing more attention on cross-domain customer review based ontology construction. It seems very little efforts have been taken to construct cross-domain application ontology. Online reviews help customers to get product information in detail. Bringing the reviews of same product from different e-commerce platform into single platform will enable customers make well informed decision. Customers may purchase online product by comparing reviews as manual comparison of reviews is too difficult. In future very large amount of cross-domain applications would be connected to make smart shopping possible. In this paper, two major e-commerce portals, Amazon and Flipkart's reviews are collected, processed and analyzed using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and semantic similarity. Next, precision and recall, ontology construction and execution time are calculated using state of art models. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The process of classifying a small text piece into positive, negative or neutral is called as Sentiment Analysis. For example, if a message is considered, then the meaning of the sentence is identified and then analysis of the sentence has to be done. After analysis, we decide that the sentence is either positive, either negative or neutral. This is referred to as Sentiment Analysis. Nowadays, most of the people prefer the online products compared to the direct buyers. So, the online marketing is growing very high. In fact, the online marketing is fully satisfying the customer needs so that it occupies a great place in people's heart. They are also satisfying the demands of customers with high quality and low price. These are the primary reasons for the online marketing to be in a successful position. If an e-commerce company has an ability to gather information about the customer thoughts and behavior, then the online marketing will be more effective than now. In this paper, we have taken a particular e-commerce dataset called Flipkart and classify the polarity of the comments by using some of the classifiers namely Support Vector Machine Classifier, Guassian Naïve Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier. The existing approach is that the comments were classified based on the attitude of the customer. But, now the proposed approach has been implemented with the help of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network Classifier which is simulated by the SPYDER tool. The accuracy for all the four algorithms namely, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network algorithm has been computed and the best accuracy has been predicted by comparing them. Here, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) shows the best accuracy of all others and the accuracy is 99.94%. Moreover, some performance metrics has been determined here. The performance metrics namely Precision, Recall and F-measure has been evaluated for each algorithm individually and then the comparison is made among them. Then, the ROC curve is measured for the classes designated by us for revealing the recognition of parameters between two diagnostic groups. It is predicted individually for each class. At last, the Confusion Matrix is going to enumerate for each algorithm distinctly. It presents the actual and predicted values in a tabular format thereby measuring the performance of a classifier. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Digital retail is a technology-driven business. Customers shop with the help of cutting-edge self-service technologies deployed by marketers to enhance customer experience and e-service quality (e-SQ). However, there is a lack of understanding of how customers differentiate between various digital retailers while shopping. We attempt to compare similarity and dissimilarity between top e-retailers based on customer perception grounded in seven dimensions of e-SQ using data from an important emerging market. Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) technique was applied to analyze similarity judgments of the respondents to draw an aggregate perceptual map of the selected e-retailers. Subsequently, discriminant analysis was carried out and the results were used to create combined spatial maps of e-retailers and e-SQ attributes. It was found that consumers can perceive top e-retailers as similar or isolated brands. Our findings suggest that all seven e-SQ attributes can create differentiation among leading e-retailing brands. However, we recommend e-retailers to fortify their service recovery dimensions, as consumers give greater importance to them. Further, we benchmarked fulfilment and contact as critical dimensions for managing e-SQ from the top two e-retailers (Amazon India and Flipkart) and discussed how they are deploying cutting-edge technologies to beef up these dimensions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Feature Selection (FS) is the selection of certain features by using a criterion assessment application. In the age of technological advancements and innovations, there has been a significant rise in the use of different social networking applications such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Alibaba, Flipkart, and others. It has increased the use of sentiment analysis in the different real-world applications so that there is a classification of text in different preset polarities such as optimistic, pessimistic, and impartial. The current research aims to find out the selection process involved in choosing the optimal features for classification using sentimental textual data. The study presents the scope of the sentimental analysis using textual data, fundamentals of the classification process, and the significance of the feature selection schemes so that there is an implementation of effective feature selection for text classification and analysis of sentiments. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={In this paper, we evaluated the sentiments in the present technological age over the reviews of online products, online products are used by the majority of people. They provide their feedback and then products are recommended for purchase and sale on that factor too. The large e-commerce platforms such as Flipkart, Myntra, Amazon, and many others enable their users to review the Products. To buy a commodity, the consumer will examine to have a better-quality understanding of the product and product work. The interpretation will be a really simple product polarized into positive, neutral, and negative Product checks. We may use machine learning methods to perform this experiment. Sentiment Analysis is research in which consumers are conscious of a product reaction. A Kaggle of amazon product reviews gathers the data collection used. We use various Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest methodology for classifying feedback and achieving the best of precision. Among all the algorithms used we find that the Random forest machine-learning algorithm to be the most accurate. © 2021 IEEE.},

The rate of fake reviews in E-commerce industry and even other platforms is increasing when depend on product reviews for the item found online on different websites and applications. The products of the company were trusted before making a purchase. So this fake review problem must be addressed so that these large E-commerce industries such as Flipkart, Amazon, etc. can rectify this issue so that the fake reviewers and spammers are eliminated to prevent users from losing trust on online shopping platforms. This model can be used by websites and applications with few thousands of users where it can predict the authenticity of the review based on which the website owners can take necessary action towards them. This model is developed using Naïve Bayes and random forest methods. By applying these models one can know the number of spam reviews on a website or application instantly. To counter such spammers, a sophisticated model is required in which a need to be trained on millions of reviews. In this work 'amazon Yelp dataset' is used to train the models and its very small dataset is used for training on a very small scale and can be scaled to get high accuracy and flexibility. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Online shopping is an electronic business that allows people from all over the world to buy goods of their interest via web and various applications. Nowadays, these facilities are provided by famous E-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal etc. Online shopping is one of the best businesses running over the Internet and hence it becomes the prime responsibility of these platforms to provide the best-rated products at the most feasible price. This paper provides a mechanism that can be used by various online shopping platforms to analyze the reviews given by the buyers, using sentimental analysis in order to maintain good service amongst their users. Sentimental Analysis is one of the most trending research areas in the domain of Natural Language Processing. It is defined as the technique that helps in the analysis of people's emotions, sentiments from written text. In this paper, various Machine Learning classification algorithms have been used for finding the polarity of the reviews. Specifically, comparative analysis of algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine has been done. Performance evaluation of these algorithms has been done on the basis of the accuracy achieved. The observed results show that the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Bag of Words model outperforms other algorithms and shows the highest accuracy of 88.76%. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommendation systems (RS) have become a hot topic in the study, intending to assist consumers in finding goods online by offering choices that closely match their interests. Recommending a product to customers exclusively based on a quantitative review may result in the recommendation of a product that is irrelevant. Various recommendation algorithms are used by online e-commerce companies like Amazon and Flipkart to offer different choices to different customers. Amazon now uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which expands to enormous data sets and produces high-quality real-time suggestions. This type of filtering compares the users purchased and rated items to similar things, the results are then compiled into a user-friendly list of recommendations. The goal of this research is to create a product suggestion system for an e-commerce platform that is tailored to the preferences of customers. Collaborative Filtering is one of the methods for generating suggestions. Recommend products to consumers based on their previous purchases and the ratings left by other customers who purchased comparable things. This paper discusses a model-based collaborative filtering approach, which assists in the development of predictive items for a specific user by recognizing patterns based on preferences gleaned from various user data. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={With the rise of online retailing, two popular forms of distribution contracts used by e-commerce platforms are the wholesale contract and the agency contract. Under the wholesale contract, e-commerce platforms purchase products from upstream manufacturersfor a wholesale price, and then determine retail prices for consumers. For example, BestBuy and Zappos adopt the wholesale contract.Under agency contract, manufacturers sell their products directly to online consumers by paying platform usage fee to e-commerceplatforms. This contract has been widely embraced, for example, Taobao in china and Flipkart in India. Although both contracts areemployed, different distribution contracts lead to different channel efficiency. Under the former one, the manufacturer sets thewholesale price, followed by the e-commerce platform setting the retail price, which leads to the problem of double marginalization.Under the latter one, the manufacturer sets the retail price, which reduces the problem of double marginalization. Therefore, theagency contract is more efficient than the wholesale contract. However, the manufacturer must pay platform usage fee to the ecommerceplatform under the agency contract. So, the choice of the contract between the manufacturer and the e-commerce platformneeds the deeper understanding.In addition, many manufacturers sell products through not only the e-commerce platform, but also the direct channel. In the directchannel, the manufacturer directly sells products to end consumers, which can mitigate the double-marginalization effect caused by thewholesale contract. If one manufacturer sets a direct channel, which contract should it use? In other words, how the direct channel affects the choice of the contract between the manufacturer and the e-commerce platform? Does the increased platform usage fee alwaysbring benefits with the e-commerce platform? Does the manufacturer always benefit from the direct channel? Under which contract is thesupply chain more efficient?Motivated by that, we consider a supply chain, in which one manufacturer sells products through not only the direct channel, butalso the e-commerce platform channel. In the e-commerce platform channel, the manufacturer may choose the wholesale contract or theagency contract. We use multistage game to study the firms’ equilibrium decisions. Under the wholesale contract, the manufacturerfirst sets a wholesale price, and then the manufacturer and the e-commerce platform set the retail price, respectively. Under the agencycontract, the manufacturer sets the direct price and the agency price, respectively. By a game-theoretic approach, we gain the followingresults.In the beginning, comparing the e-commerce platform’ s equilibrium payoffs under the agency contract with that under thewholesale contract, we get the conditions under which the agency contract is preferred or the wholesale is preferred by themanufacturer. When the platform fee rate is large, the manufacturer always prefers the wholesale contract. And when the platform feerate is small, the manufacturer prefers the agency contract (the wholesale contract) if the discount coefficient is small (large).Similarly, we can attain the conditions under which the agency contract is preferred or the wholesale is preferred by the e-commerceplatform. When the platform fee rate is large, the e-commerce platform always chooses the agency contract. And when the platform feerate is small, the e-commerce platform chooses the agency contract (the wholesale contract) if the discount coefficient is large(small). Therefore, we can achieve a Pareto improvement zone, in which both the manufacturer and the e-commerce platform preferthe agency contract to the wholesale contract.Next, we examine whether the manufacturer should introduce the direct channel when it sells products through the e-commerceplatform channel. The result indicates that the manufacturer always benefits the direct channel regardless of the agency contract or thewholesale contract. The reason is that the direct channel can alleviate the double marginalization effect under the wholesale contract,and in face of the threat of the direct channel, the e-commerce platform will decrease the platform usage fee.And then, we study how the profits of the e-commerce platform depend on the platform fee rate. Generally, the more the platformfee rate is, the more profits the e-commerce platform can get. However, we achieve different conclusions. When the discountcoefficient is small, the e-commerce platform is better off as the platform fee rate becomes larger. But when the discount coefficient islarge, the e-commerce platform is worse off as the platform fee rate becomes larger. The reason is that when the platform fee rate isquite large, the manufacturer will increase the retailing quantity of the direct channel, and then decrease the retailing quantity of the ecommerceplatform channel.Finally, we also compare the efficiency of the online retailing system under the agency contract with that under the wholesalecontract. We find that the agency contract makes the online retailing system higher efficient than the wholesale contract when thediscount coefficient is small, otherwise, vise versa. The reason is that the direct channel alleviates the double marginalization effect ifthey adopt the wholesale contract, but the direct channel decreases the efficiency of the online retailing system under the agencycontract © 2021.

abstract={On the basis of the statistics published by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the annual online retail sales in 2018 was 906.5 billion yuan, which accounts for an increase of 23.9% over the previous year. The shift in consumer buying methods has led an increasing number of enterprises to choose to sell products online, some large enterprises (e.g., HP, Apple, and Lenovo) have established their own direct sales channels. However, most companies can only sell their products by entering third-party online sales platforms, in which the marketplace model has achieved great success. This phenomenon has also prompted some online sales platforms that apply reseller model to introduce a marketplace channel, changing from the reseller model to a hybrid model of reseller and marketplace models (e.g., Amazon, JD, and Flipkart). Nevertheless, some online sales platforms insist on not opening and still adopt the reseller model (e.g., VANCL and JMEI). After opening the online sales platform, online retailers enter the platform, and the number of sellers on the platform increases, which prompts more consumers to browse products through the platform. Particularly, brand retailers can bring huge customer flow to the platform after entering it. The market scale has become larger, and the platform charges a certain percentage of the commission fee to online retailers on the platform, which provides the impetus for the platform to open up. However, if the online sales platform opens up, online retailers will compete directly with the platform after they settle in, which may be detrimental to the sale quantity of selfoperated products. On the basis of the above realistic background, this study intends to explore the following questions. Should online sales platforms open up? After online sales platforms open up, what will happen to the price, sale quantity, and service level of selfoperated products? How do consumer preferences for online retail products affect the optimal decisions and revenues of online sales platforms and online retailers? In view of the above problems, this study constitutes online sales models before and after the opening of online sales platform based on the development background of the platform. Considering the growth of market scale after the online sales platform opens up, the sensitivity of consumers to service and their preferences for the online retailer's products affect the decision making of online sales platforms. Game method is used to obtain the equilibrium decision before and after the opening of the online sales platform, and the optimal opening strategy of the online sales platform is obtained through a comparative analysis. The study shows that: (1) the decision to open the online sales platform is mainly related to the market scale growth after the platform opens up and the sensitivity of consumers to the service. When the market scale growth is large, or the market scale growth is medium-range and consumers are more sensitive to service, the online sales platform prefers to open, otherwise, they do not. If consumers have less preference for the online retailer' s products, when the market scale growth is fairly large and consumers' sensitivity to the service is in the medium range, or when the market scale grows greatly and consumers aremore sensitive to service, after the online sales platform openes up, the price of self-operated products will increase, otherwise it will decrease. After the online sales platform openes up, the sale quantity and the service level of self-operated products are always improving. (2) As consumers become increasingly sensitive to the service, the price, service level, sale quantity, and revenue of self-operated products all increase, whereas the price, sale quantity, and revenue of online retailer products all decrease. (3)After the online retailer enters the platform, as consumer preferences for the online retailer' s products increase, the price and revenue of self-operated products will decrease, while the service level, the price and revenue of the online retailer' s products may not necessarily increase. (4)With the increase in commission rate, the price and revenue of self-operated products, and the price and sale quantity of the online retailer' s products all increase, while the sale quantity and service level of self-operated products and the revenue of the online retailer all decrease. © 2021.

abstract={Examining the product review or review on web service facilitate to increase the product quality or web service. By means, comments from online shopping sites such as Amazon, Flipkart, EBay etc will not only assist the users to purchase the product however besides be able to guide the producer/supplier to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the goods. Mining online shopping websites with their information will becomes a major important task. Web Mining plays a major important role to mine the details of online websites efficiently. Web mining is the process of data mining that learns without human intervention and mine information obtained from the documents in web and also services. Sentiment categorization and web mining has become a truly significant task recently, with profound business and research impact. Machine learning algorithms and soon after deep learning methods have been the market leaders in sentiment analysis. The advent of capsule networks has been a landmark event in deep learning. It has been truly proficient in image processing. In case of text classification, standalone capsule networks are not optimally suitable. Here, a hybrid BiLSTM-Capsule framework is introduced for sentiment analysis of web texts of reviews from various datasets. In the model beginning, there is a bidirectional LSTM layer after which is an attention layer and a final capsule layer. This review analysis will helps to improve the products from amazon, increase the movie quality. The analysis of outcome depending on MR, IMDB, SST and Amazon datasets indicated the introduced framework performs better than some benchmark deep learning models. Significantly, the BiLSTM-Capsule can put its words in sentimental trend showing the capsules’ attributes without utilizing the linguistic knowledge. © 2021},

abstract={E-commerce means shop anything from anywhere. Electronic allows firms and individuals to buy and sell products and services online. In this technology-driven world, consumers prefer the fast-go-to electronic markets over traditional markets. This study illustrates the research conducted to study the growth of India’s top e-commerce platforms. To provide more statistically significant results, a survey was conducted, and data was collected from local respondents. The survey consisted of queries concerning the user’s requirements and needs. This paper also describes how user-experience is one of the main concerning factors in e-commerce. We have observed that Indian consumers most widely use these websites—Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart. Further, we use a decision tree to analyze the data and derive India’s most used e-commerce platforms’ growth rate. Rapid miner, a data mining tool, was used to acquire the decision tree. Using Tableau, data visualization was performed based on the collected primary data. To further identify factors influencing customers to shop online on the preliminary data, SPSS software was used. It was found that there exist three key determinants—Home delivery, flexibility, and security. K-means clustering algorithm identified similar groups within the secondary data. Based on data collected, this study highlights that Amazon is one of the widely used e-commerce platforms by Indian consumers. The role of UX in the growth and development of e-commerce is mentioned based on the usability test conducted with potential users. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={These days the importance of automation has been increasing drastically; time consumption is also one of the most important factors that affects the productivity. The other factors that should be considered are less human effort, reduced lead time, elimination of work force from unproductive jobs, clear and hassle-free system. In most of the electronic commerce companies like Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra etc., the sorting of different type of products happens based on the customer orders. It becomes a huge problem for selecting an item from a very big warehouse. There are already many such kind of sorting system that are present in most of the companies but the main drawback is that, the existing systems are not so efficient and appropriate in the sorting mechanism. Above being the case, the project deals with improving the sorting system in more appropriate and efficient approach. In current scenario, the sorting is done by a rover and is completely programmed. When the order is placed by the customer, the rover gets the signal, i.e., location of the object or the rack position, where the product is present in the warehouse. The rover moves to the required location and gets the entire rack to the labelling counter. In the labelling counter, the operator picks the required object and leaves the rest, then again, the robot places back the entire rack to the previous location, as a result, there will be a lot and lots of loss in time and power. Above being the case, the warehouse sorting is modified in such a way that the above-mentioned problems will be resolved. The objective is to redesign both the rover and the rack in order to sort the items with ease and efficient. The rover is completely automated, the user simply need to give the initial location and the final destination of the product to sort. Rover is programmed to reach the required location of the rack. The specified items are placed onto the rover and it will bring the specified object to the labeling counter. On the other hand, rack is designed depending upon the dimensions of the object and the purpose. A mechanism is developed for rack to place a required object onto the rover. This will simplify the process so that the operator need not have to search the product from the entire rack. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={General observation points out that Start-Ups normally dominate Technology Disruption as they are constantly looking for those left out segments of markets, which have been overlooked by established players. This phenomenon can be currently seen in the crowded airfreight industry where start-up AI companies are promising air freighters with productivity efficiency and enhancement because of rising costs. AI start Ups are also offering services like major upcoming mega-events so that freighter and airlines can tap potential customers and relevant stakeholders for revenue and bottom-line enhancement. The airlines are also attracted to such AI start Ups, because of the IATA forecast for the current fiscal year, "a decline in global profits for airlines". As per IATA, overall profits are set to decline by 7% to $28 billion in the year 2020. Today AI is even promising to make inroads in a spectrum of operations areas, like targeted advertising, aircraft maintenance offering relative demand comparison services to airlines. The net result of these is benefits for freighter and carriers who change their offering, after looking at the high demand for freight or focus on filling seats at lower prices when they know there will be slower periods for passenger seats and lean demand for the freight sector. Airlines and freighters whose portfolios have significant dependence on freight are turning towards research based AI tools rather than gazing at crystal ball or sky gazing through spreadsheet matching events versus their offerings. AI startups have also started making inroads on one hand in providing insights to airlines on high-value cargo, and other hand promising passengers with lucrative benefits of alternative flights to accommodate cargo's weight. Further service experienced by B2C (which is raised by Online Retailing Co. like Amazon, Flipkart) is now has a domino effect on B2B organizations especially for freight forwarders who are looking for data to raise their standard bars. This exploratory paper draws data from literature and secondary sources to drive the point that how AI is making inroads on the freight and cargo industry of the future. It also paints a realistic picture of the future of these industries. © 2021 IEEE},

abstract={It is difficult to decide upon the efficacy of an online sale simply from the discount offered on commodities. Different features have different influence on the price of a product which must be taken into consideration when determining the significance of a discount. In this paper we have proposed a machine learning based heuristic to quantify the “significance” of the discount offered on any commodity. Our proposed technique can quantify the significance of the discount based on features and the original price, and hence can guide a buyer during a sale season by predicting the efficacy of the sale. We have applied this technique on the Flipkart Summer Sale dataset using Support Vector Machine, which predicts the efficacy of the sale with an accuracy of 91.11%. Our result shows that very few mobile phones have a significant discount during the Flipkart Summer Sale. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Learning outcomes: The learning outcomes are as follows: factors to be considered in devising the best post-acquisition brand identity and outline market research techniques, which can be used to identify the best-suited post-acquisition brand identity strategy. Case overview/synopsis: The case study discusses the brand strategy, which Walmart Inc needs to adopt post its acquisition of Flipkart Pvt. Ltd (Flipkart) Group in India. Flipkart had acquired Myntra Designs Pvt. Ltd (Myntra) and Novarris Fashion Trading Private Limited (Jabong), but had kept their brand identity intact; Walmart Inc was faced with the decision on moving ahead with the brand strategy of keeping individual brand identities or merging all of these into a single brand identity. The study aims to provide valuable insights into the decision-making process adopted by Walmart Inc. It includes also the role of cause-related marketing in the positioning of Myntra as a socially responsible brand. The case study opted for an exploratory research design study using the qualitative research method of in-depth interviews. In total, 10 experts in the area of marketing, market research and marketing communication were interviewed. The qualitative data were analyzed using a template approach, which analyzes the text using a codebook or an analysis guide. The analysis guide already has clearly defined themes or categories. As the qualitative interviews progress, these themes get revised. These themes are analyzed qualitatively rather than statistically. The case study suggests to the management of Walmart Inc that they need to merge Myntra and Jabong based on the degree of similarity of consumer demographics, income/social class of buyers, brand identity and buying behavior. Myntra needs to retain as opposed to Jabong, as Myntra is perceived to be a socially responsible brand that creates a purchase disposition in the minds of the consumers. A more extensive quantitative study would offer better generalizability. It was not feasible to conduct a quantitative study due to time constraints. This research would have used advanced brand imagery assessment techniques such as multi-dimensional scaling to suggest if an overlap exists between consumer segments of Myntra and Jabong. The case study provides a decision-making framework to firms and individuals who are part of organizational teams to create a post-acquisition brand strategy in the e-commerce market. The case study fulfills a need for many academicians and practitioners to understand the decision-making process followed in devising a post-acquisition brand strategy in India.

abstract={Corona virus (COVID-19) has been rampant in most countries across the world, leading to a global crisis, and it has been so dangerous because of its ability to spread through any medium especially when there is physical contact of any object. So, this puts many people including the farmers and the customers at a bigger risk when they sell or buy products physically in a market place. This is a major challenge to an Indian farmer today to sell the product at the right price at the right time. Moreover, social distancing is the need of the hour, and hence, it is an even bigger challenge to monitor the market place to avoid physical contact. Also, many initiatives by governments, local bodies, and cooperative societies to eliminate the intermediaries are not turning effective due to the non-awareness, non-accessibility, ignorance, and ease of usage difficulties. Keeping the current pandemic situation in mind and social distancing being the need of the hour, this paper proposes a speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR) wherein the farmer and the customer can sell and buy products online, i.e., without any physical contact. In the current technology era, online market platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Olx are effectively cutting short these supply-chain overheads by establishing a direct connection between buyer and seller. Hence, the proposed implementation of a speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR)-based online market place for farmers which even ensure social distancing will help to reduce the spread of the virus. The objective of this work is to build an agriculture-based mobile application with speech-enabled interactive voice response (SEIVR) based on speech recognition application with the Telugu language as a case study. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The supply chain profitability is a major concern for organisations due to cost elements involved in the supply chain functions. The financial challenges are more intense in e-retailing business than other sectors where the dependency on the supply chain is highest. The supply chain plays a crucial role in deliberating the cost of product and profitability for the manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. This paper analyses the supply chain issues faced by e-retailers and proposes ways to save cost, improve performance, and cater to the needs of customers. This study has adopted the descriptive research design and conducted interviews of employees, warehousing staff, and delivery associates of e-retail companies (Flipkart and Amazon) to get the inferences. The outcome of the paper signifies the means for cost optimisation, enhancement in operations, and improvement in the delivery performance of e-retail supply chains. It also proposes the cost management model for e-retail supply chains to operate effectively in the Indian environment. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Online purchases have been significantly increasing in the web world. Some of the big giants who have dominated the E-Commerce market worldwide are Amazon, FlipKart, Walmart and many others. Data generation has increased exponentially and analysis of this kind of dynamic data poses a major challenge. Further, facilitating consumer satisfaction by recommending the right product is another main challenge. This involves a significant number of factors like review ratings, normalization, early rating, sentiment computations of a sentence consisting of conjunctions, categorizing the sentiment score as positive, negative and neutral score for a given product review. Finally, the product which has the highest positive and least negative score must be suggested for the end user. In this paper, we discuss the work done under rating based numerical analysis methods which considers the transactions done by the end user. In the second part of the paper, we present an overview of sentiment score computed and its significance in improving the efficiency of recommendation systems. The main objective of this review is to understand and analyze different methods used to improve the efficiency of the current recommendation systems, thereby enhancing the credibility of product recommendations. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Entrepreneurial finance varies as per the startup stage, such as bootstrapping, crowdfunding, angel investors, venture capital (VC), banks and initial public offer (IPO). Many times, entrepreneurial finance comes with knowledge, experience, innovation, value, etc., in addition to the fund brought in. Venture capitals are the most common such contributors. This study illustrates some significant value-added activities by venture capital firms operating in India. It explores some evidence from venture capitals such as Tiger Global, Accel Partners and DST Global who fund Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce firm. © 2021 Lahore University of Management Sciences.},

abstract={In recent years, there is a rise in platforms like YouTube, Amazon, Netflix and many other Web services. Thus, there is a need of recommender systems in our lives. Recommender systems have become unavoidable in online journeys. Also, people are largely depending on online shopping platforms. When people buy from online shopping platforms they search and browse various products for their purchase. And even if they only browse, they can see the products everywhere on the Internet, i.e., on their social media platforms, blogs, etc. So, online shopping platforms like Flipkart and Amazon use recommendation systems to recommend products related to their customers. These platforms collect information about their customer’s pattern of shopping and purchasing behavior to give accurate and needful recommendation to the customers. In this paper, various recommendation systems are discussed. Comparative analysis is also performed for these recommendation systems. It also gives the idea of how these recommendation systems help to improve and manage audience for online shopping platforms. It also discusses that how the similarity can be measured among the items for content-based filtering and similarity among users for collaborative filtering. It also describes that hybrid-based filtering can be used to overcome the disadvantages of content-based and collaborative filtering to give item of interest and other items recommendation to users. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The escalation of online shopping trends, social networks, and blogs makes shopping customers to know premier and quality product from customer reviews posted on social networks. Also, the business enterprise can perceive customers like opinion, demand, and expectation in real time. Customers are expressing their opinion, feedback, and emotions of online products through social networks and blogs. The problem focused here is, from customer point of view, identifying trendy and quality product for online purchasing, enterprise seeking customer’s opinion, brand reputation based on the reviews in social networks and blogs. The main problem is, for a single product, customer’s opinions are vast and vary in different social networks (Twitter, Facebook) and blogs (Amazon, Flipkart). This problem is addressed in this work for extracting useful hidden information by integrating the reviews of social networks and reviews in blogs. The proposed work on opinion mining has developed a new technique with a set of rules for combining social network reviews (Twitter reviews, Facebook reviews) and blog reviews (Amazon reviews). Then the reviews are mined to provide crisp information of reviewer opinion on products to new customers and organization. The new information will assist customer to make a wise decision for buying products. With the extracted information, the enterprises can read the customer's mind to improve their business by offering to customer trending products. The proposed model has achieved more than 80% accuracy and f1-score in sentiment prediction. The result has efficiently proved the performance of the model. © 2021 IETE.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to gain insights from the online product reviews of e-commerce sites such as Flipkart and Amazon and analyze its impact on third party sellers. To judge the authenticity of a product, reviews are more useful than ratings, since ratings do not give a complete picture. It is always preferred to consider both the product and seller reviews to have a seamless delivery and defect less product. In this paper, natural processing methods are used to gain insights by considering online reviews of a product. Methods such as sentiment analysis, bag of words model help to understand the impact of online product reviews on the seller's ratings and their performance over some time. The reviews are categorized into positive, negative, and neutral using sentiment analysis. Further, topic modeling is done to find out the topic reviews are majorly referring to. The seller reviews for a specific product after analysis are compared with the overall seller reviews to judge the authenticity. The results of this paper would be beneficial to both the consumers and sellers. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

The online grocery market value has been increasing steeply in recent years and is going to grow steadily, as the digital natives—the Millennial and the generation after them—grow older and start having families of their own. Given the importance of this growing market, there is surprisingly little research on the factors that are driving the adoption of online grocery in India today. Based on an extensive literature survey we first propose a conceptual model on the factors driving the online and offline grocery shopping behaviour of Indian consumers. We test the model using an online survey and a pan-India sample of 262 consumers. Our analysis suggests that the intention to purchase grocery online is significantly influenced by variety seeking, trust in seller, ease of use of online payments, convenience, purchase decision involvement, and preference for global products. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Sarcasm is a special way of expressing opinion most commonly on social media websites like Twitter and product review platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, etc., in which the actual meaning and the implied meanings differ. Generally, sarcasm is aimed at insulting someone or something in an indirect way or expressing irony. Detecting sarcasm is crucial for many natural language processing (NLP) applications like opinion analysis and sentiment analysis which in turn play an important role in analysing product reviews and comments. There are a lot of challenges proposed when it comes to detecting sarcasm and it is not as simple and straightforward as sentiment analysis. In this survey, we focus on the various approaches that have been used to detect sarcasm primarily on social media websites and categorise them according to the technique used for extracting features. We have also elucidated the challenges encountered while detecting sarcasm and have considered a particular use case for detecting sarcasm in Hindi-English mixed tweets. An approach has been suggested to detect the same. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the quick increment in the quantity of web clients, the Internet has an enormous measure of data produced by the clients. Many people share their views regarding a topic on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and give their feedback or review about a product on e-commerce web sites such as Amazon and Flipkart which leads to a huge amount of data. The identification of subjective statements from the data is known as subjectivity detection. To automate the analysis of such data, sentiment analysis is used. The aim is to find the opinionative data and classify it according to its polarity, i.e. positive, negative or neutral feedback, known as sentiment classification and then analysing it which is known as sentiment analysis. However, before performing sentiment examination, the information is exposed to different pre-processing procedures which finally give the desired optimized output. This allows us to get to know about the public’s mood or opinion about a particular topic. This summarization helps the concerned organization or public to improve their product or service based on the feedback received. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

abstract={E-commerce is an exemplary representation for online commercial transactions which permits business applications in dealing with different organizations. A business intelligent (BI) technique implicated in predicting the user’s buying preference in advance such as Flipkart and Amazon is said to be recommender system (RS). It builds a product–customer relationship in an efficient manner. Thus, collaborative filtering(CF) is the most promising approach followed by the E-commerce firm in generating product recommendations to the end user. Collaborative filtering approach searches for a “like - minder ” people with similar buying preferences. The conventional machine learning algorithms used to calculate the user similarity index (USI) value are identified as Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), cosine (COS) and Jaccard similarity measure. These algorithmic similarity measures are not successful in several situations particularly in cold start and data sparsity problem. From the literature survey, it is inferred that data sparsity is the most important primary issue that needs to be resolved first in CFRS in order to generate a reliable product recommendation listing to the targeted user. So that a novel method called prospective Jaccard similarity measure (PJSM) was proposed. Its novelty is to overcome the data sparsity issues in CFRS method as well as the conventional algorithmic method limitations. MovieLense dataset is extracted and applied for an implementation. Research objective involves in showing rapid improvements in users’ rating prediction accuracy. Compare conventional algorithms results with the newly proposed PJSM algorithm results by finding the MAE and RMSE. Accordingly, the proposed PJSM algorithm results in showing superiority for the predicted rated data and reduces the error ratio as well. The PJSM algorithm is also effective in managing the 10 lakh data too. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={E-Shops reviews have become a valuable source of opinions, feeling, and experience by existing users which marks the failure and success of products and services. A set of favorable reviews proves that the product or service has vended well and users are pleased with them, and opposing reviews effects adversely. These reviews provide worthwhile information that might be used by prospective users to find sentiments of previously preferred users before making any decision or transaction to buy right product or service from E-shops. Moreover, service providers, vendors or manufacturers also make use of these reviews to discover public opinion, as well as limitations of their products or services. But, the basic fact about underlying online reviews shows something else. These reviews might be spurious, posted or written with hidden purposes, they often involve helpful or favorable opinion in order to boost, promote, and publicize their products and services, or with pessimistic intention to harm opponent prestige and business as well. So, the exploration and investigation of such reviews before opinion mining is significant. In this paper, a methodology is proposed which includes reviews acquisition using the Tag path clustering approach about mobile devices of different make along with metadata from Flipkart, spurious reviews detection based on identical and nearly identical reviews using semantic similarity with review length. Further, an opinion mining process is carried out by using the lexical database (SentiWordNet) approach for the computation of sentimental degree and orientation of both spurious and legitimate reviews © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={From many e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Flipkart and Netflix to online advertisements, recommender systems are used to recommend certain products to their users depending on their preferences and interactions with the products. Sequential recommender system is useful to model the short term behavior of the users depending on their latest interactions. Many techniques ranging from Markov chain models to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to solve the sequential recommendation problem. The most efficient state-of-the-art-model that uses CNNs is the top-N sequential recommendation system [1]. This model fails to capture the skip behavior in the union-level patterns as it doesn't take the interaction between distant items in a sequence into consideration. This paper adopts the basic architecture proposed in Caser [1] and introduction of the joint embedding of two items, formation of a 3D tensor with all the embeddings and a introduction of a new convolutional block have been made. This novel approach improves the mean average precision (MAP) from 0.1507 to 0.1884 which is significant and gives rise to the most efficient sequential recommendation system that uses CNN. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender system (RS) has grown widely in various communities over the last few years. It creates curiosity among the researchers due to the recent growth of various commerce companies, especially Flipkart and Amazon. In collaborative filtering-based RS, the system aims to provide the users with their personalized items, which is based on the users’ past history. In general, these observations are represented in the form of rating matrix. However, these ratings are not uniform as some user ratings are stringent and others are lenient. As a result, the RS is incompetent to suggest the personalized items to the stringent users. In this manuscript, we design a normalization-based collaborative filtering recommender to overcome the above problem. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases, namely designing and evaluating. In the first phase, the proposed algorithm finds the average user rating per item and counts the number of users purchased each item. Then it uses min–max normalization to find the normalized user count per item and scale the average ratings of users in a specified range. In the latter phase, the proposed algorithm divides the rating matrix into training and testing rating matrix, and predicts the users’ ratings. We perform rigorous simulations using a large variety of users and items, and compare the results with a collaborative filtering-based RS using ten performance metrics to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, we evaluate the results through a statistical test, t-test and 95% confidence interval. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={E-commerce entities like Flipkart and Amazon have been alleged to be in violation of the laws governing foreign direct investment [‘FDI’] in India. Additionally, the business model adopted by them appears to be in contravention of the Competition Act, 2002. On 26 December 2018, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade [‘DPIIT’] had issued Press Note 2 (2018 Series) which introduced a series of changes in the FDI norms in the e-commerce sector. (These changes have been incorporated in the FDI Policy vide Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India) (Fifth Amendment) Regulations, 2019, dated 31 January 2019, Notification No.FEMA.20(R) (6)/2019-RB, available at, https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_FemaNotifications.aspx?Id=11496 [Last accessed on: 21 April 2020].) The Press Note was purportedly introduced to protect the interest of small and medium sized enterprises in India. In this article, the author argues that the changes which are introduced by the Press Note go against the very purpose of their introduction as it leaves every stakeholder in a worse off situation by allowing easy circumvention. After high-lighting the issues arising from amendments introduced by the Press Note in Part I of this article, the author delineates the anti-competitive nature of the business model of the e-commerce entities in Part II of this article. The author proposes that the appropriate method to remedy the problem surrounding the e-commerce sector would have been to make the appropriate amendments under Competition Act, 2002 rather than to opt for the FDI route. © 2020 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.},

abstract={Social Media is good information medium for disclosing information of products and services of E-Commerce Business. This information is provided by customers themselves on their purchased product. Aspect based sentiment analyzes of feature/specification quoted by the customers. Such specifications/reviews are available in Twitter, Flipkart websites. This research work considered reviews of features/specifications on Twitter and Flipkart websites. Hence this work focused on analyzing the problems of customer on buying quality products. This work is automated to extracts the semantic based aspects or features and their opinion for the task of analyzing comments. Fuzzy logic and NLP are employed in this work with consider all categories of comments to measure their given weightage by customer tweets. For experimentation real time Twitter data and Flipkart data has been used. Experimental result and performance analysis report proved that aspect based sentiment analysis on social data on this work is performing well. In this work hidden information about the product specification has been retrieved and produced concise information to customers perceives about the product specification and eases the customers to take decision on the purchase quality product. And also assist the business organization to take decision on the product specification and improve their business according to their customer's opinion and expectation. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, smartphones are being used to manage almost all aspects of our lives, ranging from personal to professional. Different users have different requirements and preferences while selecting a smartphone. There is 'no one-size fits all' remedy when it comes to smartphones. Additionally, the availability of a wide variety of smartphones in the market makes it difficult for the user to select the best one. The use of only product ratings to choose the best smartphone is not sufficient because the interpretation of such ratings can be quite vague and ambiguous. In this paper, reviews of products are incorporated into the decision-making process in order to select the best product for a recommendation. The top five different brands of smartphones are considered for a case study. The proposed system, then, analyses the customer reviews of these smartphones from two online platforms, Flipkart and Amazon, using sentiment analysis techniques. Next, it uses a hybrid MCDM approach, where characteristics of AHP and TOPSIS methods are combined to evaluate the best smartphones from a list of five alternatives and recommend the best product. The result shows that brand1 smartphone is considered to be the best smartphone among five smartphones based on four important decision criteria. The result of the proposed system is also validated by manually annotated customer reviews of the smartphone by experts. It shows that recommendation of the best product by the proposed system matches the experts' ranking. Thus, the proposed system can be a useful decision support tool for the best smartphone recommendation. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={People are choosing products from online ratings and comments. Experience from Amazon, Flipkart and other leading online shopping portals in India, the buyer 's product choice is mostly based on the other buyer's review. We have found an interesting case study of Netflix video recommendation based on so many criteria. Product recommendation is one of the demanding area of recent time where efficiency of prediction of which product a buyer can choose over other hundreds of product is a challenging task. Artificial intelligence has helped researchers in developing algorithm that has self-aware method for machine with machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. In this research, we are introducing a hybrid approach of recommendation for products. There are many ways to find out the people who have similar choice and combining their choices can lead us to suggestions for other products. Collaborative filtering method has been being used for Recommender frameworks for quite a while now. They have been fruitful in comprehending numerous issues of the systems which are being used in the market. User- behavior analysis, sentiment score, product reviews, popularity score can be a decisive factor along with neural network with classification method can lead to more efficient results. In this research, we present some of more potential areas of working on Collaborative Filtering technique with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Self attentive product recommendation is one such technique which focuses on automated form for recommendation which is independent of a dataset and its data type. We have examined other approaches for joining different calculations for predicting client evaluations and furthermore examine a few outcomes from the investigation of different procedures utilized by earlier analysts and discover answers for them. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In the recent decade, several technologies have boomed up due to recent development in many technologies. These technologies have changed the life of human being and are increasing the profit for individual, organisations like NetFlix, Alibaba, Flipkart, etc. Today in this world, maximum people are surrounded by smart objects or using smart objects to make their life easier to live and convenient. But, on another side life is being made easier to live by analytics companies/ industries. For example, which user like which type of plays, movies, songs, etc., things are extracted by many companies. Such recommendations are being made and being provided improved services to the respective users. Such jobs are being done by Data Scientist. Whereas, Data science (a future of Artificial Intelligence) is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured (labelled) and unstructured (unlabelled) data. Moreover this, Big Data Analytics are the analysis mechanism used in Data Science by Data Scientist. Several tools like Hadoop, etc., are used to analysis the large amount of data and used in predicting the valuable information/ making decisions. But, in analysing we faces several concerns like complexity, scalability, privacy leaking and trust. So, this article discusses about such concerns, challenges (rising) in this emerging field in detail (with a comparative analysis/ taxonomy). © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Social influence causes ideas to diffuse across the globe and track the rate at which awareness spans through online social communities. The users with better connectivity and higher interactivity bear greater potentials of spreading as well as perceiving the social trend. This concept has been further considered in the research to identify such prospective users in social network with high probability of influencing the opinions of others to whom they are connected. For the experimentation, Twitter profiles of 1900 followers from three major e-commerce portals, including Amazon, Snapdeal, and Flipkart, have been extracted to serve as the social network for conducting research. Acquired data is further narrowed down to yield a set of influential users in terms of central and centrally active, which are parameterized by neighborhood size and frequency of Twitter activity of individuals. Diffusion analysis is further performed on the derived set of key influencers to track the rate at which information propagates in the network. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.},

abstract={Customer product reviews, collected from manye-commerce sites like Amazon, Flipkart have been wildly used to study the customer purchasing habits, purchase motivation, recommendation systems etc.Sentiment analysisis the term given to the analysis of purchase behavior from reviews. Opinion Mining is one of the major branches of Natural Language Processing (NLP). One of the tasks of Opinion miningis to predict positivity or negativity or neutrality out of users’ opinions throughonline reviews. Aspect level opinion mining is the concept of analyzing the customer reviews at aspect levels, i.e., opinion mining will be performed forproducts’ features analyzation.This paper proposes a two stage model for opinion mining of customer reviews on laptops extracted from review dataset from SemEval-16. In the first stage data preprocessing and identification of product aspectwhere implemented. Later opinion mining at the aspect level using convolutional neural networks is performed as the second stage. Finally results were presented. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

abstract={The rapid shift towards digitalization today has actually transferred the market to an entirely digitalized platform. The participation of such a large number of users has given rise to a huge amount of data over the internet, proving the need for proper structuring and removal of unwanted and redundant data. The presence of a system that gives them the complete overview of a product is a dire need for the public today. Diving deep, we nd technologies that help us in the analysis and modification of data found over the internet. Sentiment analysis helps us nd the opinions people have towards a variety of entities, through a series of processes. Along with this, we have text summarisation which aids in the attainment of meaningful information from the wide range of irrelevant and redundant data found online. Clubbing these two, we can obtain concise reviews in addition to the overall sentiment towards selected entities. Here, we propose a model where we convolve into a system that provides the user with the overall recommendation found on popular e-commerce websites (Amazon, Flipkart and TripAdvisor). Starting with the collection of data from given sources, we pre-process the data, we combine machine learning with a lexicon-based approach, obtain the summaries and sentiments and eventually provide the user with the popular opinion behind the product. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The purpose of this paper is to identify the dimensions of mobile network service quality which influence the online customers for m-commerce adoption. This theoretical paper offers a conceptual framework for the mobile network (4G) by proposing six service quality dimensions and also took two mediating variables which also have their possible sub-dimensions. The identified mobile network service quality dimensions are speed, trust, satisfaction, security, privacy and cost. This framework builds on and is integrated with the TAM model. The proposed model was tested through pilot survey of 50 students of a university, who are using mobile for commercial transactions. Findings confirm that mobile network service quality positively influences m-commerce adoption in today’s world, as people are more concerned about technologies which have better service quality dimensions. The study also reveals that the most preferred network is 4G LTE and mostly used m-commerce portals are Paytm, PhonePe, Amazon and Flipkart. Copyright © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={The advent of modernization has led to a spurt in technological advancements. Consequently, the internet boom has resulted in the way we live our lives. The Internet has served as a platform for businesses which has yielded better results as compared to the traditional way of outdoor selling. Amazon, Netflix, Flipkart are such companies that have flourished online. These businesses use recommender systems to increase their selling based on customer preferences. These systems not only use a customer’s buying habits but also involve knowledge of reviews, ratings, correlation, similarity etc. involving several customers and items. Recommendation systems have been a part of research in their own respect. New robust algorithms have been developed over time aimed at improving system efficiency. This paper highlights the types of recommendation systems. Different systems follow different principles for providing user recommendations. An overview of such systems is showcased in the paper. The paper proposes a model based on a hybrid recommendation technique involving a combination of content and collaborative approaches. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={A substantial portion of the query volume for e-commerce search engines consists of infrequent queries and identifying user intent in such tail queries is critical in retrieving relevant products. The intent of a query is defined as a labelling of its tokens with the product attributes whose values are matched against the query tokens during retrieval. Tail queries in e-commerce search tend to have multiple correct attribute labels for their tokens due to multiple valid matches in the product catalog. In this paper, we propose a latent variable generative model along with a novel data dependent regularisation technique for identifying multiple intents in such queries. We demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model against several strong baseline models on an editorially labelled data set as well as in a large scale online A/B experiment at Flipkart, a major Indian e-commerce company. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Nowadays, in e-commerce, item recommendation to the buyers is one of the key promotional activities followed by all the e-commerce companies. While the users navigating the site, the recommendation systems help them to pick the items that they recently interested or that they recently viewed that are currently discounted. This article narrates various factors that are influencing the factors for the development of business in e-commerce using data analytics. Our analysis is performed based on log data of Flipkart; it is one of the large e-commerce sites in India. From our analysis, it shows that before selecting an item for recommendation, we have to consider various factors in parallel. The factors include as follows: item should match with the customers’ shopping interest in the previous session, discount information for the product, and recent popular items. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the commencement of new technology and increase of online shopping companies like Amazon, E-Bay, and Flipkart, people give a wide range of reviews for the products they purchase. Some are too long, some too short, some difficult to understand while some are totally irrelevant. Thus, there is a pressing need to reduce the diversity of reviews for a particular product and to show the users only the gist of most useful and important reviews about a product. The proposed work focuses to summarize the reviews for movies purchased from Amazon using a combination of four state-of-the-arts algorithms and a feature selection technique. Sentiment analysis has been performed to categorize the reviews into positives and negatives. Also, a novel method named hierarchical summarization is proposed to summarize large reviews into summary of few sentences. The results of this summary are compared with the existing algorithms using the ROUGE score to determine the best summary. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={In the backdrop of the digital revolution we are witnessing, value creation through conventional production of goods and services is being challenged every now and then. These days, the digital economy, from entertainment to shopping, forms a crucial part of millions and millions, but its value added is slipping through our grasp. The fact of the matter is that sizeable shares of the value additions these companies do are moved out of countries where corporate tax rates are high to the accounts of companies in tax havens. This means that the productivity gains achieved through the digital economy does not necessarily translate into increased tax revenues for the government. The big names in the digital business market, at present, have been accused of paying virtually no tax in those populous countries where they operate. For example, Google’s revenue reached about US$74.5 billion in 2016 and yet Google is known to be subject to low effective rates of taxation and even accused of deferring taxes on revenues over US$24 billion only in the United States. Other European countries like Italy, France and others have proposed to tax the income of these digital entities but somehow it never materialized. At the outset, the paper presents a theoretical model to show how that liberal tax laws have always been attractive for shifting profits. In this background, the paper discusses the outsourced holding company model of tax avoidance used by digital business platforms like Flipkart with a special focus on India and hence decoding the tax design that can be operationalized by the fiscal authority to ensure increased tax revenues from digital value creation under such a case. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Supply chain management has revolutionized how business can be carried out and become successful. Seventy nine percentagesof companies with high-performing supply chains achieve revenue growth superior to the average within their industries.A great deal of cost can be saved by improving, streamlining, and optimizing the supply chain. At the same time the market for E retailing in India has gained a great momentum with consumers preferring to go online to buy products and theyoung generation to go for e-commerce has increased over a period of time because of the wide variety of products available at a very competitive price, convenience and availability. Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal and many other have come up in the market and are able to sustain the local retailers because of the wide variety that they offer in the online stores. Real time information on the E-retailing websites and enabling collaboration between trading partners are the main fragment of Supply chain management. But eventually the biggest challenge of the online stores is managing their supply at distinct location and making it available to the consumer within the committed period. All this requires a strong supply chain management system in place and create the competitive advantage to the company as well. This research focuses much on how effectively the supply chain management practices of amazon was carried out to create competitive advantage and sustain in the market with special reference to Bengaluru based customers. The data was collected primarily using the questionnaire by survey method, analyzed, interpreted and the results are presented to overcome the current challenges and efficiently utilize the opportunities. © 2019 SERSC.},

abstract={Recommendation System (RS) is software that suggests similar items to a purchaser based on his/her earlier purchases or preferences. RS examines huge data of objects and compiles a list of those objects which would fulfil the requirements of the buyer. Nowadays most ecommerce companies are using Recommendation systems to lure buyers to purchase more by offering items that the buyer is likely to prefer. Book Recommendation System is being used by Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Flipkart, Goodreads, etc. to recommend books the customer would be tempted to buy as they are matched with his/her choices. The challenges they face are to filter, set a priority and give recommendations which are accurate. RS systems use Collaborative Filtering (CF) to generate lists of items similar to the buyer's preferences. Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that if a user has rated two books then to a user who has read one of these books, the other book can be recommended (Collaboration). CF has difficulties in giving accurate recommendations due to problems of scalability, sparsity and cold start. Therefore this paper proposes a recommendation that uses Collaborative filtering with Jaccard Similarity (JS) to give more accurate recommendations. JS is based on an index calculated for a pair of books. It is a ratio of common users (users who have rated both books) divided by the sum of users who have rated the two books individually. Larger the number of common users higher will be the JS Index and hence better recommendations. Books with high JS index (more recommended) will appear on top of the recommended books list. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={At present, online shopping has become a growing process, in which the profit statistics are posted by familiar e-commerce corporations like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, etc. However, this kind of online shopping unkindly omits the touch and feel of the products that can be used to estimate the product quality as the main factor while buying the commodities from the shops. The estimation of product quality is more significant during the purchasing of online products. Therefore, many opinion mining and sentiment classification methods were introduced to purchase the best products through online shopping. But, these classification methods haven’t attained the effective product classification with best reviews and ratings. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature extraction method PCA (Principle Component Analysis) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) with SVM (Support Vector Machine) using lexicon-based method to classify and separate the products from the large set of different products depending on their features, best product ratings and positive reviews. In this process, the online products will be isolated and listed according to their high positive reviews. The data preprocessing is applied to the dataset to get the data accuracy before the execution of feature extraction and classification. The dimensionality reduction and best visualization of large data set are executed by applying the PCA and t-SNE method. The sentiments are also been extracted by this hybrid feature extraction method to acquire the best neighboring product ratings. The polarity of words is discovered using a lexical based approach to extract positive reviews for obtaining the best products. Finally, the SVM is exploited to the classification of products. The performance of the proposed method is estimated with precision, recall, accuracy and complexity that can provide the entire accurateness of the system. © BEIESP.},

abstract={As the trend to shop online is increasing day by day and more people are interested in buying the products of their need from the online stores. This type of shopping does not take a lot of time of a customer. Customer goes to online store, search the item of his/her need and place the order. But, the thing by which people face difficulty in buying the products from online store is the bad quality of the product. Customer place the order only by looking at the rating and by reading the reviews related to the particular product. Such comments of other people are the source of satisfaction for the new product buyer. Here, it may be possible that the single negative review changes the angle of the customer not to buy that product. In this situation, it might possible that this one review is fake. So, in order to remove this type of fake reviews and provide the users with the original reviews and rating related to the products, we proposed a Fake Product Review Monitoring and Removal System (FaRMS) which is an Intelligent Interface and takes the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) related to products of Amazon, Flipkart and Daraz and analyzes the reviews, and provides the customer with the original rating. It is a unique quality of the proposed system that it works with the three e-commerce Websites and not only analyze the reviews in English but also the reviews written in Urdu and Roman Urdu. Previous work on fake reviews does not support feature to analyze the reviews written in languages like Urdu and Roman Urdu and cannot handle the reviews of multiple e-commerce Websites. The proposed work achieved the accuracy of 87% in detecting fake reviews of written in English by using intelligent learning techniques which is greater than the accuracy of the previous systems. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The activities of the users are surrounded by online shopping, online content fetching and online payment of the various bills. The important point is in case of the online shopping with Amazon, Flipkart and many other online shopping sites provides some sort of intelligent assistance to the user. Based on the past history, based on the user profile. Such kind of the applications were named as recommender systems. The most common categories of recommender systems involves, the collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, multi-criteria recommender systems, risk-aware recommender systems, mobile recommender systems and Hybrid recommender systems. The current work dealing with the process followed by the recommender systems along with various key factors embedded in the usage. The suggestions given by the application to the user depends on user profile, and content searched by the user and the collaboration of other products with the current product. The work focus on the implementation algorithms existing in the process of recommender systems, the above listed categories of recommender systems follow certain key mechanisms depending on the user query. The work also deals with the performance aspects of the recommender systems in case of accuracy and reproducibility in recommender system research. Especially the mobile recommender systems there are certain limitations of region and accuracy of the results. Overall the outcome of the work is to describe the importance of the recommender systems and the internal mechanism followed by various recommender systems. © BEIESP.},

abstract={Sentiment Analysis is the identification of sentiments or opinions from the given text. Social media generates large amount of sentiment loaded information in the form of reviews. Sentiment analysis is used to identify the customer's opinions from user reviews. Online purchasing have became more fashionable due to its varieties, low cost and immediate supply. in today's competitive ecommerce market ratings and reviews of various brand is used to understand how consumers really feel about the product. The feedback environment is developed to help the customers to buy the correct product and to guide the companies to enhance the features of product depending on the consumer's demand. The customer feels difficult to accurately find the review for a particular feature of a product that they intend to buy. Also, there is a mixture of positive and negative reviews. To avoid this confusion and to make this review system more transparent and user friendly, feature based opinion extraction is carried out. in this paper the rating from the online shopping website known as flipkart.com is analyzed, based on the aspects of the product the rating is classified as positive, neutral and negative. The proposed work is analyzed by using Machine Learning algorithm called Random Forest and simulated by using SPYDER. in our system the accuracy, precision, F-measure and recall is calculated for both Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and then accuracy comparison is made these two algorithms. in which the Random Forest gives the best accuracy of 97% than the Support Vector Machine. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The terms machine learning, deep learning and data science are buzz words now a days. The usage of these techniques with some technologies like R and Python is most common in the industry and academics. The current work is dealing with the inherent logics existing in the algorithms like Classification, Dimensionality reduction and Recommender systems along with the suitable examples. Some of the applications mentioned here like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to exploit the usage of these algorithms in their daily usage. The discussion about online platforms like Amazon, Flipkart are other areas where the recommender systems were most commonly used algorithms. The outcome of the work is the logical things hidden in the usage of the algorithms and the implementation wise which are packages and functions helpful for the implementation of the algorithms. The belief is the work will be helpful for the researchers and academicians in the context of algorithmic perspective and they can extend the work by contributing their thoughts and views on the same work. Unlike in the normal programming, R/Python simplifies the logic of algorithms so that the lines of code and understanding of the problem is bit simple when compared with general programming languages. The work explains the mail respondents related to the allocation of the house by the company as a response to their mail by considering Urban, semi-urban and rural areas of the customers, the income range of the customers also observed in the allocation of the house. The implementations are with R by using classification and the corresponding results were published with the explanation of the values found in the implementation. © BEIESP.},

abstract={This paper proposes smartphone application named Virtual Cart for facilitating an easy and convenient method for purchasing in shopping malls. Nowadays, due to the lifestyle and demands, majority of human beings are becoming increasingly occupied, need of the hour is to get all personal works done easily with minimum effort and time-consumption. Shopping at malls is a frequently carried out activity in. There can be a big rush at malls on holidays, weekends especially during special offers and discounts. Contrast to shopping in malls, people prefer online shopping to get required items through Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal etc., where they cannot have the look and feel of items unless they receive the delivery. So, to solve this problem we have proposed Virtual Cart, using which, one can overcome the complications of online and offline shopping by ensuring a better shopping experience. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The Competition Commission of India approved India’s highest-valued acquisition, Flipkart by Walmart, within the first phase of investigation itself, stating that it is “not likely to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India.” Unlike many other retail acquisitions, there has been strong protest from the traders and retailers’ organization to stop the deal and for the creation of an exclusive e-commerce policy and regulator. Meanwhile, the Draft National E-Commerce Policy, 2018, suggested greater regulatory scrutiny for mergers and acquisitions that may distort competition. In this context, the present study looked into the competition dimension of the deal and other related issues. The study suggests to evolve a regulatory system with long-term vision to sustain and support the domestically grown innovations while making the competition assessment more flexible to accommodate the challenges posed by digital revolution. © The Author(s) 2019.},

abstract={Seeking out customer reviews has become such standard part of the buying process for people these days that every retailer needs to be thinking about them. But often customer reviews are found extensively in online shopping sites such as Amazon, Flipkart etc. and social media sites such as Facebook, twitter etc. But when a product is purchased from a retailer offline, these reviews are usually unattended and mining for the exact review will be time-consuming. Also, in large super-markets, the customer interaction is not as much as in online shopping so as to provide with details such as related products, what products were also purchased by the product who purchased the particular product etc. All these drawbacks are erased with our proposal to enhance customer interactivity through a smartphone application. Our proposed system uses a unique concept of ‘community-computation’, a variation of distributed systems for processing. The results of the proposed system show that by implementing such a real time system, the shopping experience of a normal customer can be enhanced and also the same will pave way for next-generation shopping. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The case is set around the acquisition of majority shares of Flipkart by Walmart. The case traces the evolution of Flipkart as a startup and explores the context of acquisition by Walmart as well as the strategic fit between the two firms. Technological changes—mainly the proliferation of internet, mobile technology and the consequent digitization—have irretrievable impacts on the retail segment in terms of convergence of on-line and off-line retail and globalization of the markets. The case explores the emerging digitization scenario and its impact on the retail segment as a trigger to the merger process. Flipkart as an Indian startup had to re-incorporate outside India due to policy restrictions on fundraising. The case points to the inadequacies in the Indian policy regime with respect to startup fundraising and differential voting rights. Based on international comparisons, the case triggers discussion on the directions to policy changes if India hopes to create a congenial start-up ecosystem and if the dream of Digital India is to be achieved. © 2019 SAGE Publications.},

abstract={Soft Computing techniques are getting more popularity in Digital Media market as it helps to increase the efficiency and profitability in the e-commerce business. Soft intelligence approaches minimize the amount of time to converse the best solution from huge solution base; hence it can process real time huge data for the Business Environment especially for a product or a group of products in the online e-commerce business. To survive in the global competitive business environment for any enterprises, it's necessary to use artificial intelligence to harness its power to reshape the business with the change in demand of people needs. Consumers are highly educated and are aware of the product features along with the best deals over online business sites. The online market leaders in India like Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal are taking customer feedback on a product on regular basis and extracting values after analyzing them to devise strategies to attract more and more customers for their products. The purpose of our research work is to propose a new algorithm Hybrid Bee Optimization (HBO) based on Social behavior heuristic algorithms that can be utilized to attract customers based on their past feedbacks and purchased behaviors. The best feature of our proposed algorithm, Hybrid Bee optimization (HBO) is to search products from a huge listed product based on features based on the social behavior of consumers on a product or a group of products. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender systems are in trend from last two decades. Most of the early recommender systems were made using content-based and collaborative filtering methods. Computational intelligence and knowledge base were used in mid-90s. Later recommender systems used social networking, group recommendations, context-aware, and hybrid systems. Today in the era of big data and e-commerce, massive amount of data from web and organizations provide new opportunities for recommender systems. Increased information obtained from high volume of data can be used in recommender systems to provide users with personalized product or service recommendations. From 2013, most of the social networking site like Facebook and Instagram and online shopping giants like Amazon, Flipkart, etc., started providing personalized recommendations to engage and attract users. Most of the review papers are full of applications of recommender systems which do not give the clear idea about methods, techniques, and shortcomings of these systems. Hence, this paper presents an analysis of methods and techniques in current (majorly from 2013) recommender systems. Current challenges have been identified to carry out the work in future. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Can I trust a review? A very common question for someone accustomed to online shopping. The Internet hosts a large number of reviews. Many e-commerce Web sites like Amazon, eBay, Flipkart ask their customers for their reviews once the product is bought. There is an important aspect of trust in an online context. Often reviews diverge widely on their star ratings from 1–5 which clearly show bias for a brand or product. What actually guarantees the reliability of a review? Some of the effective ways to ensure the trustworthiness of a review are to use the reviewer profile information and his previous reviews. Opinions of others have a greater impact on consumers rather than verified information provided by the product’s producer, thus, ensuring that misleading reviews do not creep in is a necessity. The goal of this work is to develop a trustworthy reviews model by taking into consideration all the factors which make a review reliable. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.},

abstract={In the current world, millions and millions of options are available if we want to buy a mobile. Amazon itself has over millions of mobiles to choose from. There will be even more choices in the near future. So the problem is that to find the relevant stuff. Amid all those millions of mobiles there are probably quite a few numbers that a person wants. There are millions of choices available for everyone to purchase things in this current world. It's very difficult for everyone to find their relevant stuff. In order to find our relevant stuff we can get suggestions from our friends or from any experts but still we require some computational help to get the suited one from the millions of choices. Data mining is focussed on finding patterns on terabytes of information. In this paper we described a case study which applies data mining to analyse the ratings of mobiles from three different popular websites: Amazon, Flipkart and Smartprix. The result reveals the power of data mining techniques to find the similar mobiles based on their ratings from these three datasets and also the comparative study between these three websites. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender systems (RSs) are one of the emerging applications in electronic commerce companies, such as Amazon, Flipkart, eBay, Levi's and many more. It generates a list of probable recommendations for the customers or users of the companies in one of the two categories, namely collaborative filtering-based (CF) and content-based. In CF, the recommendation is based on a user's past behavior and other similar users' behavior. Many algorithms have been developed for finding the recommendation in CF recommender systems. One of the popular algorithms is k-nearest neighbor (NN), in which the recommendation depends on the behavior of k similar users. More specifically, the user rating of a non-rated or unpurchased item is the aggregate value of k similar users. However, the user rating is unknown iff the k similar users have not rated the corresponding item. In this paper, we propose a user-oriented CF algorithm for RSs. The proposed algorithm selects k similar users by finding the similarity count with other users for a given item. We implement the proposed algorithm and compare with NN algorithm. Simulations using four generated datasets show the supremacy of the proposed algorithm in terms of the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), precision, recall and F-score. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The Indian e-commerce industry has made rapid strides due to increasing Internet connectivity, better technology, growing young population, and greater access to smart phones and other mobile devices. The acquisition of Flipkart by U.S. retail giant Walmart for $ 16 billion was a precursor to the increased consolidation in the online-retail market space in India. The country today has become a highly competitive market for both these international players and home-grown e-tailers. It is imperative for all the players to carve out a niche for themselves in the market and differentiate their offerings to have a loyal consumer base. This study used structured equation modelling to determine cues that lead to e - loyalty, which eventually results in customers repurchasing from the same e-tailer. Data were collected from 317 online consumers using a structured questionnaire, which showed that product offerings, convenience, past purchase experience, and web-store environment had a significant impact on e - loyalty. Convergent and discriminant validities were established through confirmatory factor analysis. The overall model fitment was established by validating the structural model and hypothesized relationships. The findings highlighted the importance of e - loyalty and its influence on repurchase behaviour. This research provided important insights into the minds of the Indian consumer and provided details about which areas the e-tailors need to focus upon to maintain their competitive edge in the market. © 1964 - 2018.},

abstract={Web document clustering identifies the relevant and useful information like comparing shopping service provider from flipkart.com, information retrieval from web search engines and so on. Choosing the best representation and enhancing knowledge discovery for a given task in very large textual data stores is the most critical step in web document clustering. In this work, considering the problem of discovering the most predominant word with similar semantic model and measuring relative strength of predominant word of web document. This paper presents an efficient technique called Rayleigh Clustering with Self Organizing Map (RC-SOM) for web document domain using generation of self organizing patterns, clustering of predominant word and Rayleigh distribution. Self organizing patterns are generated to identify the most predominant word from web document. Then clustering of predominant word with similar semantic are organized for all the web documents. Finally, the efficiency of web document clustering is improved by applying Rayleigh distribution that lists out the relative strength of predominant word for each web document. The experimental is presented for RC-SOM technique on Anonymous Microsoft Web Data dataset and performs evolution factor such as cluster accuracy, execution time and computation space for cluster. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

More and more products are sold via e-commerce because the ease of access and efficiency of Internet has made trading very popular. Youth are trying to order most of their daily necessities online, but surely till now, this hasn't affected the sales of day to day commodities. These shopkeepers, who are willing to enter the online arena are overwhelmed by all the technological ideologies and technical nomenclatures. They want to market themselves online with very little technical knowledge involved in the process. The proposed solution is a platform for shopkeepers to market their commodities and services to an average consumer. This solution is a middleware between shopkeepers and consumers which acts as a recommendation system. We are trying to bridge this gap where consumers are more technology-oriented and shopkeepers lie at another end of the spectrum. In turn, the shopkeeper can also benefit by getting a data feed about most searched commodity in their vicinity. The consumers, on the other hand, get to choose which shops to visit or get their product delivered from. This would reduce the monopoly caused by the e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart in the market. Also, the consumer enjoys instant knowledge about the availability of the product. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Data mining, text mining and opinion mining in one form or another has occurred since people started maintaining records in the modern era. Online posting on products from different popular sites like twitter, flipkart, amazon etc. has been increased, so research on sentimental analysis is going for long time. Due to increase in number of users for online shopping, accessing social media websites that generates huge amount of data in form of user reviews, messages, blogs and tweets results in. So there is need for sentimental analyses, which classify and categorizes these reviews in order to gain insights from this user generated data. This research aims to automate the process of gathering online, end user reviews for any given product or service and analysing those reviews in terms of the sentiments expressed about specific features. This includes pre-processing of inapplicable and unusual data, classifying that data into different classes and finally providing end user with the summarized data about the expressed sentiments. In this research author have designed an application, which analyses the data (mobile reviews of different users) collected from amazon and classify this data into positive, negative and neutral using two machine learning algorithms like naï ve base and K-nearest neighbour. The results show that the accuracy of KNN is better as compared to naï ve base. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Many enterprise organizations, like large e-commerce platforms, are consolidating their ICT infrastructure on private clouds to harness cloud properties of scalability and elasticity. Administratively many of these cloud deployments use pre-defined VM sizes to ease effort of use and placement. With this sizing, workloads' requirements poorly match with the offered sizes leading to poor VM and host utilisations. This paper proposes alternate VM sizing approaches to overcome this and compares internal, external resource fragmentation in each case. To evaluate this, utilisation traces from the private cloud of Flipkart, having thousands of servers and VMs are used. Evaluations show that applications as well as host utilisation benefits accrue by customising VM sizes to application requirements. We also show how VM sizes and host configurations influence consolidation ratios and utilisation. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Subject area: Brand Management, Branding Strategy, Strategic Management. Study level/applicability: The case study is suitable for postgraduate management programs, such as MBA, Executive MBA and executive development programs. Case overview: This case study provides a detailed analysis of Amazon India’s branding strategy by way of analyzing popular branding campaigns such as “Try to kar”, “Aur Dikhao”, “Kya Pehnu” and “Apni Dukaan” that enabled the global brand to reach to the masses of Tier-II and Tier-III cities in India. Facing fierce competition from existing market leaders such as Flipkart and Snapdeal, Amazon India strategizes to attract Indian consumers by rightly capturing their behavior in terms of demanding “highest power of options”, “fashion choices”, “originality” and “trust” with its local flavored advertisement campaigns enabling it to create a “trusted, reliable and local” brand identity. With the help of sufficient data and numbers about the industry, company and competitors, the analysis presents a clear picture of the current status of Amazon in the Indian e-commerce space and leaves the readers with food for thought concerning whether this “culture-specific” branding strategy will enable Amazon to become the number one choice for Indian online shoppers in the near future. Expected learning outcomes: This case study helps students to understand how global MNCs use unique branding strategies to capture mass-markets in e-commerce business, the role of culture-specific aspects in developing differentiation strategies and the role of local flavors in branding strategies and internationalization.

abstract={Nowadays, online platform has become a modern means of shopping among people. The reviews of products by customers have been proliferating on the online platform for a while. Since a large number of reviews are available, invariably customers read reviews before buying the product. Majority of the reviews are lengthy and repetitive, some of them even have nothing to do with the product itself. Going through the reviews before making a decision has become a tedious task. Further, the product selection is a complex decision making problem where several criteria are involved in the decision making process. Researchers have used methods like machine learning and sentiment classification to analyze the review of customers to summarize them. However, review summarization does not suggest the best/worst product. This study aims to recommend the best product based on the opinions expressed in the customers' reviews. We analyze the reviews of customers from various online platforms and use effective multi criteria decision making approach to evaluate and recommend the best suitable product. Real-time dataset from Flipkart and Amazon are used to evaluate our system's performance. Different case studies have shown that our proposed method produces a promising result which can help the user in the decision making process. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={The recent acquisition of Flipkart by Walmart will accelerate the process of transforming the retail sector in two important ways. It will bring in the know-how and capital of a retail giant, and will give a boost to online retail. While this helps transform the retail sector in India with clear long-run benefits, definite job losses in informal retail and probable rises in food prices in rural markets due to sourcing by big retailers are the short-run problems. If the government ignores the short-run problems, the transformation may become politically infeasible. © 2018 Economic and Political Weekly. All rights reserved.},

abstract={On September 9, 2014, Samsung Electronics announced the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini and stated that the model was to be retailed exclusively through flipkart.com, India's leading online retailer. Retailing experts expected the Galaxy S5 Mini's launch announcement to further hurt Samsung Electronics' relationship with brick and mortar retailers who were not happy with the company's policy of selling through e-tailers. This was followed by another announcement by Samsung on September 18, 2014, in which the company, due to mounting pressure from brick-and-mortar retailers, conveyed its decision to extend exclusivity on selling rights of 48 models, including its much-awaited Galaxy Alpha and Note 4, to offline retailers. This move was also criticized by experts who predicted e-tailing to be the future of retailing. This case traces the predicament of Samsung Electronics for selling its products using multiple channels. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={This research intends to empirically examine within the ambit of Indian consumer electronics market the relationship between product prices and select product, market, and consumer related facets. Product distinctiveness (function of product commonality), consumer choice probabilities and numeral ratings of consumer reviews associated with product offerings within a market segment are considered the representative elements of product, market and consumer related dimensions respectively in this research. Initially, employing the one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) technique, the test for statistical equality of product offering’s (of key market players) prices within a market segment is carried out. Thereafter, employing the multi linear regression (MLR) technique, the empirical relationships between product pricing and product distinctiveness, consumer choice, and consumer ratings are established. The devised research framework is demonstrated for the smartphone product offerings listed at the website of India’s leading e-retailer (Flipkart) in the price band of Rs. 5000–10,000. Our analysis reveals several key managerial insights. An important insight that results from our study pertains to the fact that consumer ratings provided by end users in this market segment does not seem to influence the product pricing considerably. Another noteworthy insight refers to the fact that subject to certain threshold price within this segment, the consumers really does not discriminate in purchasing product offering(s) of one manufacturer from the other. © 2017, Operational Research Society of India.},

abstract={Today, digital reviews play a pivotal role in enhancing global communications among consumers and influencing consumer buying patterns. E-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, etc. provide a platform to consumers to share their experience and provide real insights about the performance of the product to future buyers. In order to extract valuable insights from a large set of reviews, classification of reviews into positive and negative sentiment is required. Sentiment Analysis is a computational study to extract subjective information from the text. In the proposed work, over 4,000,00 reviews have been classified into positive and negative sentiments using Sentiment Analysis. Out of the various classification models, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decision Tree have been employed for classification of reviews. The evaluation of models is done using 10 Fold Cross Validation. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Rating platforms enable large-scale collection of user opinion about items (e.g., products or other users). However, fraudulent users give fake ratings for excessive monetary gains. In this paper, we present Rev2, a system to identify such fraudulent users. We propose three interdependent intrinsic quality metrics-fairness of a user, reliability of a rating and goodness of a product. The fairness and reliability quantify the trustworthiness of a user and rating, respectively, and goodness quantifies the quality of a product. Intuitively, a user is fair if it provides reliable scores that are close to the goodness of products. We propose six axioms to establish the interdependency between the scores, and then, formulate a mutually recursive definition that satisfies these axioms. We extend the formulation to address cold start problem and incorporate behavior properties. We develop the Rev2 algorithm to calculate these intrinsic scores for all users, ratings, and products by combining network and behavior properties. We prove that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge and has linear time complexity. By conducting extensive experiments on five rating datasets, we show that Rev2 outperforms nine existing algorithms in detecting fraudulent users. We reported the 150 most unfair users in the Flipkart network to their review fraud investigators, and 127 users were identified as being fraudulent (84.6% accuracy). The Rev2 algorithm is being deployed at Flipkart. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={E-commerce companies such as Amazon, Alibaba and Flipkart process billions of orders every year. However, these orders represent only a small fraction of all plausible orders. Exploring the space of all plausible orders could help us better understand the relationships between the various entities in an e-commerce ecosystem, namely the customers and the products they purchase. In this paper, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for e-commerce orders. Our contributions include: (a) creating a dense and low-dimensional representation of e-commerce orders, (b) train an ecommerceGAN (ecGAN) with real orders to show the feasibility of the proposed paradigm, and (c) train an ecommerce-conditional-GAN (ec2GAN) to generate the plausible orders involving a particular product. We evaluate ecGAN qualitatively to demonstrate its effectiveness. The ec2GAN is used for various kinds of characterization of possible orders involving cold-start products. © 6th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2018 - Workshop Track Proceedings.

abstract={On-line market places redefining mutual fund distribution with the growing e-commerce trend, competition heats up among the online market place giants. E-commerce giants look to offer new product offerings by completely redefining the online space. An article by Shashikant Singh in the dalal street, states that a study done by ASSOCHAM-Forrester, Indian e-commerce is growing at an annual rate at 51%. This is the highest in the world and is expected to reach USD 120 billion in 2020. The retail sector is also registering a positive trend of 11% CAGR and this is expected to touch USD 1 trillion by 2020. More and more people are being added to the virtual world daily. The entrance of technology will not only impact the traditional markets like clothes, books, electronic items but also new markets which have remained untouched till now. Online customers enjoy the convenience of shopping from the comfort of their homes for grocery, listening to music. This comfort shopping which customers experience can very soon become a reality for investors of financial services industry. With the digitalization fast catching up the mutual fund industry, investors can choose to make investments conveniently like shopping. This also fulfils the financial inclusion notion of RBI successfully. The initiative assures that mutual fund products become more accessible. The aim of the paper is to trace the growing e-commerce trend in the mutual fund industry and examine the special strategies that need to be adopted given the unique nature of the industry, where investment advice is a prerequisite for most first time investors. The study is descriptive in nature. The importance of extending online market places like Flipkart and Amazon to sell mutual funds to make these products more accessible to people are discussed. © 2018 Society for Innovative Research.

abstract={E-Commerce companies face a number of challenges in return requests. Claims of missing-items is one such challenge, where customer claims that main product is missing from shipment through return comments. It is observed that dominant part of such claims are inadvertent given the limited literacy of customers. Some of them have fraud intent. At Flipkart, such claims are evaluated manually to examine whether the comment relates to missing item. Classification of the claim intent automatically saves human bandwidth and provides good customer experience by reducing the turn around time to customers. However, this is challenging as comments are replete with spell variations, non-English vernacular words, and are often incomplete and short. This is compounded by noisy labeling of such comments due to human bias and manual errors. To classify the claim intent, we apply conventional as well as deep learning methods. To handle label noise, we employed state-of-the-art noise-aware techniques, which fail to perform due to pattern specific label noise. Motivated by the wide pattern specific label noise, we encode domain heuristics as labeling functions (LFs) which label subsets of the data. However, LFs may conflict and prone to noise. We address the conflict by defining a conflict-score to rank the LFs. Proposed method of noise handling with LFs out performs all the state-of-the-art noise-aware baselines.

abstract={Today online shopping has become a predominant one, almost everybody on this sphere use to do online shopping. Here, customer reviews are playing an important role. A customer cannot read all the reviews given for a product and without any doubt, each and every single review has its own weightage. Short reviews may have more weightage than the lengthy reviews and the vice versa is also possible. This Product Recommendation System allows the user to get an overall score about the reviews like star rating and this will help the user to have some idea about the product. The mentioned product’s, review, specification and it’s customer weightage is fetched from the online shopping site (Flipkart) using Jsoup HTML Parser. The fetched reviews are then preprocessed. Gold Standard Usefulness Score is calculated by comparing the number of consumers who rated the review useful among the number of customer’s read it. Usefulness features such as Lexical Similarity and Shallow Syntactic Features are estimated. The next stage of the process is to estimate Usefulness Regression, e-SVR (Support Vector Regression) and n-SVR of SVM (Support Vector Machine) family is used to detect the Squared Correlation Coefficient and Mean Squared Error for each numerical attribute. Usefulness Regression is followed by Review Aggregation, three types of review aggregation is done they are SimAvg, PredAvg, and GsAvg. The Aggregation is displayed and based on these values the product is recommended. This paper goal is to develop a sentiment analysis that performs, by labeling the users comment to positive or negative about the particular product. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Online sale through a common payment pylon is purely an E- Commerce website which allows the user to sell or to buy products from different vendors (Ex: Flipkart, Snapdeal, Amazon & lot more) by using a single payment pylon which reduces the user to give all the banking credentials to all the gateways. There has been a rapid growth in online business from the past 2 decades and there has been rapid growth in cyber attacks too in this regard giving the banking details multiple times for multiple gateways will lead to mislead for the data given by the user. Here in this E-commerce website we can sell our used product and buy used products from different sources. It provides an Excellent platform to sell or to buy the products from different E-commerce websites using a single payment pylon. Our website reduces the risk of stealing Bank details of the customers. This paper depicts the quality of the website and explains us about the security features. © 2018, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There has been a tremendous change in the way people buy and sell products/goods/services in the past decade, the modern way of shopping is done through E-commerce (Online Shopping) Amazon, Alibaba, flipkart are the current giants in E-Commerce. There has been a huge inclination towards online shopping due to various reasons such as wide-range, availability, various choices, easy to compare, can be brought/sold from anywhere, Unlike offline stores the consumer cannot verify the product before buying, the alternative way for this is relying on the reviews and ratings of the products. Which might be generated by various customers or spammers, as the range of the users cannot be confined there not accurate rating or review that can truly help the consumers. In this, we aim to overcome the trouble of avoiding such inaccurate data or insufficient data in terms of decision making, we aim to provide the users or customers a reliable ranking that help them to analyse the product and evaluate the product based on the ranking generated, We intend to create an algorithm that takes the reviews and generates an overall rank that should be helpful in decision making of the consumer. We plan to achieve this by using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques such as sentimental analysis and various NLP kits such as CNTK, KERAS Wrapper etc. for text mining for mining the review texts collected. © IAEME Publication.},

abstract={Modern life is truly fast paced and lives of most people are overburdened. In such a scenario online shopping is a great and time saver. Ladies clothing cannot be easily specified like grocery or furniture items. Normally, ladies clothing has numerous characteristics that are hard to describe like texture, shape, color, print, length etc. In this work, we propose a way to search for clothes where the query is in the form of image in place of descriptive set of words. The first step of the procedure is to identify in accordance with the length of the dress and sleeves. Next features like color and texture are obtained. To detect the best close match, human intervention is not obligatory. A data set of 1500 images is created. The dataset is built up from craftsvilla, jabong, voonik, myntra, amazon, snapdeal, flipkart, fashionara, shoppersstop. The outcomes confirm a precision of 89.25% and recall of 87.00%. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In recent years, with the advent of emergence and growth of various web technologies and paradigms, an exponential increase can be seen regarding its usage and applicability. This growth has impacted tremendously the way of managing and analysis of data generated on web and how it is being utilized for further planning of any large business organization by exploring different hidden patterns and associated knowledge. Nowadays, internet is being popularized among its users with different dimensions of way of expressing their opinions. As a result, there are various sources of information in form of large repositories is being generated all around, such as social networking sites, e-commerce sites (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.) and forums, etc., which is beneficial to the customers as well as the manufacturers. Feature-based opinion mining aims to produce a feature-based summary of reviews and classifying it as positive, negative, and neutral. In this paper, a method has been proposed to extract the strongly liked and disliked features of product based on customers’ online reviews. The Stanford POS tagger has been used to tag the sentences to extract information to identify the required features of any product. This work is implemented on Eclipse using JAVA. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

abstract={Big Data commerce has given a big leap to e-commerce. It has opened up the avenues to smarter and informed decision making for large industries as well as the consumers. Online reviews on e-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart are one such paradigm which can be used to arrive at more profitable decisions. They are not only beneficial for the consumers but also for the product manufacturers. Online reviews have the potential to provide an insight to the buyers about the product like its quality, performance and recommendations; thereby providing a clear picture of the product to the future buyers. The usefulness of online reviews for manufacturers to realize customer requirements by analyzing helpful reviews is one such unrealized potential. Both positive and negative reviews play a big role in determining the customer requirements and extracting consumer's feedback about the product faster. Sentiment Analysis is a computational study to extract subjective information from the text. In this research, data analysis of a large set of online reviews for mobile phones is conducted. We have not only classified the text into positive and negative sentiment but have also included sentiments of anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. This delineated classification of reviews is helpful to evaluate the product holistically, enabling better-decision making for consumers. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={There has been incredible growth of events over the internet in recent years. Google has become the giant source of knowledge for any event which has happened or happening over the internet. Some networking sites such as face book, micro blogging sites such as twitter are evolved with time and became the highly used sites over the internet. Various E-commerce websites such as Amazon, Ebay, Flipkart etc are the widely used sites for online shopping. These sites generates large amount of text data. In association with text data some images are also uploaded over the internet on these sites. To model this huge amount of multi-modal data having both textual and visual contents multi-modal topic model for summarization, analysis is suggested in this paper. While dealing with multimodality, study of semantic relationship between the images and text data is crucial part. This model also helps to study semantic relationship between them effectively. Topics which are trending, popular over the world can be seen on Social sites as well as micro blogging sites. In online shopping sites fake reviews, advertises, spam spreading information is posted. For summarizing and analyzing the data we have taken the dataset containing reviews and product information from Amazon, one of the leading E-commerce sites. This information is used for modeling topic on sites with summarization and analysis. In this paper detailed study of other previous methods is also shown. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of Internet influenced many of our day-to-day activities. Ecommerce is one of the rapid growth areas in the Internet era. People are eager to buy products from online sites like Amazon, ebay, Flipkart etc. Online sites also provide facility for customers to write review on products they buy. These reviews help consumers and vendors for making decision on marketing strategies, and the improvement of products and services. Nowadays people are very much interested to read reviews before purchasing any product and getting services. This makes areas for opinion spammers to write fake reviews to promote or to demote both products and business services. This type of activities is often referred as Review spam. Thus detecting fake reviews has become more critical issue for customers to make better decision on purchase as well as the vendors to make their products trustworthy. In this paper a detailed survey is done using various machine learning techniques for detecting spam and genuine reviews. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The core aim of this research paper is to analyze the challenges faced by an E-commerce industry in India. The Indian Economy is proliferating day by day and E-commerce industry is playing an imperative and laudable role in its progress. Still there are enormous sectors that have been untouched by an E-commerce industry in India, particularly in its rural areas. Many consumers in India still follow the traditional purchasing method. Unfortunately, altering customer perception of online shopping has been quite a tough task for the E-commerce industry. According to a survey, India is ranked fourth in the world for its number of Internet users. So, it is expected that India would come into the top 10 E-commerce hub by 2020. Indian buyers are afraid to use new technology in its Initial stage. But, if an E-commerce company could provide proper feedback and knowledge to its customers for online purchasing, it would directly help to increase the sales of the E-commerce websites. This research paper gives a theoretical contribution for analyzing the hurdles in front of the E-commerce industry. Copyright © 2017, IGI Global.},

abstract={User-written product reviews contain rich information about user preferences for product features and provide helpful explanations that are often used by shoppers to make their purchase decisions. E-commerce recommender systems can benefit enormously by also exploiting experiences of multiple customers captured in product reviews. In this tutorial, we present a range of techniques that allow recommender systems in e-commerce websites to take full advantage of reviews. This includes text mining methods for feature-specific sentiment analysis of products, topic models and distributed representations that bridge the vocabulary gap between user reviews and product descriptions. We present recommender algorithms that use review information to address the cold-start problem and generate recommendations with explanations. We discuss examples and experiences from an online marketplace (i.e., Flipkart).},

abstract={Many users of ecommerce portals commonly use customer reviews for making purchase decisions. But a product may have tens or hundreds of diverse reviews leading to information overload on the customer. The main objective of our work is to develop a recommendation system to recommend a subset of reviews that have high content score and good coverage over different aspects of the product along with their associated sentiments. We address the challenge which arises due to the fact that similar aspects are mentioned in different reviews using different natural language expressions. We use vector representations to identify mentions of similar aspects and map them with aspects mentioned in product features specifications. Review helpfulness score may act as a proxy for the quality of reviews, but new reviews do not have any helpfulness score. We address the cold start problem by using a dynamic convolutional neural network to estimate the quality score from review content. The system is evaluated on datasets from Amazon and Flipkart and is found to be more effective than the competing methods. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={This paper is regarding the lack of semantic factor in recommendation systems and describes the different recommendation techniques that are being employed in the current e-commerce website. Recommendation system can be broadly classified into three categories: content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendation approaches. Content based systems consider the properties of the items to be recommended. For instance, if a Amazon user has purchased many romantic novels, then content based recommendation system recommends novels in the database as having the 'romantic' genre. Collaborative filtering systems recommend items based on similarity measures between like minded users and/or items. The items recommended to a user are those preferred by similar users. This paper also emphasizes the need for semantics in current recommendation system to recommend products accurately. This also describes various limitations that are present in the current recommendation methods and suggests possible solutions that can improve current recommendation system used in e-commerce websites. It also includes a survey on popular e-commerce websites such as Amazon, Ebay, Flipkart Snapdeal and Paytm by rating them on different parameters and doing their comparative analyses This paper also focuses on how graph algorithm can be used to improve recommendation in ecommerce websites. The proposed system compares flickr.com recommendation of images with the proposed method. The method incorporates semantic recommendation using overlap technique based in graph. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This chapter proposes to bring forth insights as how media contributes in e-tailing. The success of online retailers owe to the role which media plays in changing the consumer mind. India's retail market value was estimated at $520 billion in 2013, and is expected to grow to $950 billion by 2018. With a CAGR currently pegged at 13%, the Indian e-commerce market is expected to grow the fastest within the Asia- Pacific Region - with its market size doubling every 2-2.5 years. This certainly gives us reason for deep introspection. While the global growth rate of online shoppers is estimated at 8-10%, India currently has more than 10 million online shoppers.

abstract={E-commerce websites are becoming popular among customers who are buying products online. Online reviews play a major role in selling of online products. Reviews give the customer a complete overview of the product thus making it popular or unpopular among buyers thus increasing its sales. In order to increase sales of a product, reviewers are writing fake reviews. In this paper, a review ranking method is proposed. This method assigns a score to each review based on different parameters. The reviews having high score are considered to be more helpful or genuine and thus are ranked higher than the reviews having lower score. The lower ranked reviews are fake reviews and thus they are non-useful to the users. The proposed approach is an effective approach which avoids heavy computation of learning. Evaluation on real-life flipkart review dataset shows a precision of 83.3% thus showing the effectiveness of proposed model. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Sentiment analysis plays a very important role in BI's (Business Intelligence) applications which has been evident in the recent market activities. Towards sentiment analysis for most of the popular websites like Amazon, Facebook, Twitter necessitate the review of the customers which are used as a feedback. It's play very important role for product review, Business intelligence as well as in decision making. The main problem that arises to the point of view of users/customers is that, it is practically in-feasible to read all those online reviews one by one, because some of the products might have tens of thousand reviews. In this paper, reviews are collected from the sources like Amazon, Flipkart, and then used a method to combine both NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning approach. Word sense disambiguation is also considered for this study. An improvised lesk algorithms is used for removing noise in the data. Different types of data have different types of properties and therefore are suited to different techniques correspondingly. This problem is closely related to the large scale nature of social networks and the necessity to perform aggregation operations, which results in the form of Pie-Chart. Thus, we aggregate millions of reviews into more user-friendly format. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Today website is considered as an image of an organization. For designing an effective website it is required to identify the need of the visitors of the website. In current scenario the objective of e-commerce websites is to provide the users or customers a platform where they can retrieve any information and also can perform other tasks like adding to cart, save for later, checkout, payment, tracking records and may more. In this paper, techniques like Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Approach (ANFIS) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) were used to assess the usability of e commerce website and propose a model to successfully assess and compare websites on the basis of usability. First of all, the important factors related to usability from the literature or educational materials were identified. A survey using these factors as base was conducted which served as a valuable input from user for identifying the parameters affecting usability, which was further used in assessing the usability parameters of the e-commerce websites (such as Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal, Myntra). A Fuzzy inference system (FIS) file was generated using the parameters identified in the survey, member functions and other rules. Training data was generated using the survey conducted. ANFIS system used this training data and FIS file to create an optimal model for assessing the usability of the websites. This model can also be used to identify the important parameters to improve usability of the website using the valuable review of daily website users via the conduct of survey. © 2016 IEEE.},

Outstanding experiences can only be created through a combination of investments in people, organization structure, deployment of technology, resources among many other aspects. The chapter also gives an overview of themes covered in this book and provides insight into each of the paper. The sector span across hospitality, retail, aviation, and restaurants. The papers are a combination of empirical and conceptual framework and the contributions from the globe. It is an age where experiences are becoming extremely important part of any consumer interface, be it face to face or digital. Memories are important and association with organizations must drive value. Technology is altering the way experiences are being created for consumers. There are also experiences around everyday life which start from commuting to workplace, telecommunication, banking, dining, entertainment, sports, travel, education, and citizenship services. It is the quality of experiences which results in consumer satisfaction and engagement. It is around concern for people’s time, convenience, and meaningful engagements which also generate opportunities for revenue generation as well. Technology drives a lot of new ways of engaging with consumers and also providing access. Also, experiences are transcending the barriers of time and geography. Firms such as Flipkart and Amazon and their success in India demonstrate how conventional barriers for entrepreneurship can be broken and how a novelty of experience and convenience can lead to success in the marketplace. When one thinks of experiences, there are a number of contexts to draw from. On one hand, it could be a Disneyland which powerfully recreates experiences from fables and stories taking one to the land of imagination and dreams. The whole experience is a powerful blend of creativity, engagement, and a mapping of service offering at a standardized level. It is a powerful engagement story, though one could argue the monotony of repetitiveness. There are also experiences in the arena of sports which draw an unparalleled euphoria and involvement. Gaming is also another such example. There is passion for teams and players and love for the sport that contributes to loyalty. The football clubs across the globe especially Europe, the love for cricket in India, and the League matches that attract big investments demonstrate a very distinct consumer experience for sports lovers. Also, there may be very ordinary engagements around consumption of food through home delivery or online channels which demonstrate a very different kind of consumer experience where value of money, timeliness, and convenience elements may be more important considerations in consumer interface. Hence, there is a spectrum of values on which consumer experience can be assessed and the value drivers may be very distinct for different segments. Experience has many facets which vary with the context in which they are being created. There is no standard form, but some of the outlying principles may be common such as consumer orientation, understanding of value drivers, keeping up the delivery promise, innovation, and excellence, among other aspects. To calibrate an experience, the context in which it is based needs to be understood. Multiple scenarios can be looked at for understanding the consumer experience. Some of these are enumerated below. © 2017 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract={E-commerce websites such as Amazon, Alibaba, Flipkart, and Walmart sell billions of products. Machine learning (ML) algorithms involving products are often used to improve the customer experience and increase revenue, e.g., product similarity, recommendation, and price estimation. The products are required to be represented as features before training an ML algorithm. In this paper, we propose an approach called MRNet-Product2Vec for creating generic embeddings of products within an e-commerce ecosystem. We learn a dense and low-dimensional embedding where a diverse set of signals related to a product are explicitly injected into its representation. We train a Discriminative Multi-task Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the input is a product title fed through a Bidirectional RNN and at the output, product labels corresponding to fifteen different tasks are predicted. The task set includes several intrinsic characteristics about a product such as price, weight, size, color, popularity, and material. We evaluate the proposed embedding quantitatively and qualitatively. We demonstrate that they are almost as good as sparse and extremely high-dimensional TF-IDF representation in spite of having less than 3% of the TF-IDF dimension. We also use a multimodal autoencoder for comparing products from different language-regions and show preliminary yet promising qualitative results. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={The term drones covers a very broad category of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) that can be used for anything from military or commercial purposes, to personal entertainment. The term drones covers a very broad category of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVS) that can be used for anything from military or commercial purposes, to personal entertainment. The government has granted permission to the Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) to use drones for aerial surveillance of its pipelines. This follows the use of drones for similar purposes by the Indian Railways and the National Highways Authority of India. as line patrolling is extremely difficult for pipeline sections passing through forests, rivers, environmentally sensitive areas and other inaccessible areas, GAIL (India) Limited has awarded an order for aerial surveillance of 200 kilometres for the Hazira Vijaipur Jagdishpur/Dahej Vijaipur pipelines with drones as a pilot project by Minister of State (independent charge) of Petroleum and Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan. Currently, it is being achieved through regular, periodic, foot-patrolling and air surveillance by hiring helicopter services on a monthly basis. With limited transport infrastructure Indian logistics must look in to use of drones Safely. Before any such change can happen in logistics industry it is high time to measure and monitor the awareness towards drone logistics among Indians. This forms the need for the present study. The study objective covers the overall awareness towards drone logistics among public. Specifically, it focuses on the awareness on benefits and cost aspects of the service in India. The study was conducted among the online customers of Snapdeal and Amazon for a specific period of two months. The customers are chosen from a reputed educational institution randomly selected using simple random sampling. The results of the study showed that 'Awareness that drone was trialed by Amazon.inc' and 'not used by Snap deal/Flipkart/Amazon.in', 'awareness of non-availability of drone delivery in India, drones are impersonal way of delivering goods' and 'awareness that drones are comparatively costlier'are significant while estimating overall awareness towards drone delivery, as the significance of 't' is less than 0.05. To conclude, the public awareness towards the usage of drone services was good and identifies it as one of the costlier services in India. © Serials Publications Pvt. Ltd.},

abstract={A plethora of literature is available highlighting the critical success factors (CSFs) of information systems (IS). While most of the studies were elusive in determining CSFs, the research of DeLone and McLean (1992) proposed an IS success model which is most comprehensive and widely applied model in various research studies carried out in this context. The model was later updated to incorporate parsimony by DeLone and McLean (2003). The updated model is based on six success factors, i.e., system quality, information service quality use, user satisfaction and net benefits. This paper attempts to examine the role of each critical success factors as suggested by DeLone and McLean (2003) towards the success of e-commerce platforms and how it can be leveraged for enhancing customer value by laying strong foundation on most vital factor. DeLone and McLean (2003) model was applied to make a comparison between Flipkart and Snapdeal which are two dominant players of e-commerce in India, so as to investigate the antecedents for the success of e-commerce platforms.

abstract={Is it possible to spot review frauds and spamming on social media and online stores? In this paper we analyze the joint distribution of the inter-arrival times and volume of events such as comments and online reviews and show that it is possible to accurately rank and detect suspicious users such as spammers, bots and fraudsters. We propose VOLTIME, a generative model that fits well the inter-arrival time distribution (IAT) of real users. Thus, VOLTIME automatically spots and ranks suspicious users. Experiments on several real datasets, ranging from Reddit comments and phone calls to Flipkart product reviews, show that VOLTIME is able to accurately fit the activity volume and IAT of real data. Additionally, we show that VOLTIME ranks suspicious users with a precision higher than 90% for a sensitivity of 70%. Copyright © by SIAM.},

abstract={To apply design thinking towards creation of garments with an aim of solving size and fit issues and minimizing returns of sold merchandise in fashion e-commerce business, a study was done with Flipkart, one of the leading e-commerce companies to understand the problems they were facing with apparel returns in the year 2014 and 2015. Based on the product return data collected from online customers, a questionnaire was formulated and a study was done in Bangalore with 1000 people in the age group of 18 to 30 years to understand why people shop online for apparels and the issues faced by them. The questionnaire analysis showed that 42% of fashion apparel was returned because they were not the right size or fit, 19% were returned because of fabric quality issues, and 8% were returned because of problems with colour. A study was also conducted by observation and personal interviews with 150 customers at various offline stores in Bangalore for the identification of attributes related to the issues of size and fit. The problem areas identified in women-wear were issues with waist, bicep/sleeves, and chest. To combat these problems, various design ideas were proposed, and the selected designs were constructed and tested on a population of 100 women in the age group of 18 to 30 years of different body shapes for size and fit. It was concluded from the results that if the garments be created in such a way that it can fit many people of varying body shapes, it can drive businesses to improve the overall customer experience by reducing rampant returns of apparel. © 1964 - 2017.},

abstract={Revenue generation of a logistics company depends on how the logistics cost of a shipment is calculated. Logistics cost of a shipment is a function of distance & speed of the shipment travel in a particular network , its volumetric size and dead weight. Logistics billing is based mainly on the consumption of the scarce resource (space or weight carrying capacity of a carrier). Shipment's size or deadweight is a function of product and packaging weight, dimensions and flexibility. Hence, to arrive at a standard methodology to compute accurate cost to bill the customer, the interplay among above mentioned physical attributes along with their measurement plays key role. This becomes even more complex for an e-commerce company, like Flipkart, which caters to shipments from both warehouse and marketplace in an unorganized non-standard market like India. In this paper, we'll explore various methodologies to define a standard way of billing the non-standard shipments across wide range of size, shape and deadweight. Those will be, usage of historical volumetric / dead weight data to arrive at a factor which can be used to compute the logistics cost of a shipment, also calculating the real/contour volume of a shipment to address the problem of irregular shipment shapes which cannot be solved by conventional bounding box volume measurements. We'll also discuss certain key business practices and operational quality considerations needed to bring standardization and drive appropriate ownership in the ecosystem. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={Since the rise of the new millennium, a rapid evolution of technology combined with an increased rate of penetration of the internet and mobile connectivity has not only brought about a paradigm shift in the way traditional businesses function but also paved the way for new business models in e-commerce to emerge. The e-retail or online shopping industry has over the past decade demonstrated a steep annual growth rate of more than 50% globally and boasts of many pioneering innovations especially in supply chain. The supply chain here revolves around three key pillars - Speed, Cost and Quality, and an imbalance among these three can derail market dominance almost overnight. Having originated in the manufacturing industry, benchmarking has been increasingly adopted with a desire to improve awareness of the competitive environment, innovate existing processes, bring about cohesion and clarity of thought within an organization as it tackles competition and more importantly achieve and maintain a high degree of validity and relevance in the market. The need for Benchmarking in e-commerce supply chain stems from the fact that this industry has always relied on disruptive innovation and has demonstrated a high level of flexibility in swiftly adopting these innovations. In such a dynamic setting, the market leadership of the incumbent would be at risk should it dilute its focus on the competitive environment. Also, being a relatively new industry, there has been a great extent of horizontal growth into many new products, offerings, markets and customer segments and this growth didn't occur in a planned or phased manner. Hence, failure to internally benchmark one's functions within the horizontally existing autonomous entities can result in the buildup of redundancy on multiple fronts and drastically affect a firm's growth velocity. Benchmarking promises a window for e-commerce supply chain to look at its environment and study the market, the existing competition and their processes. This would further help establish a cycle in which the firm systematically reinvents itself and also calibrates and reevaluates itself on a continuous basis. Thus, apart from hedging the competitive strength and safeguarding market position, benchmarking would over time help grow this nascent industry in a way which wouldn't be possible in isolation. Based on a detailed research of the fundamentals and the history of benchmarking, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework designed specifically for the e-commerce supply chain. The paper also talks about instances of successful benchmarking at Flipkart, India's largest e-commerce company. Furthermore, the paper intends to provide a glimpse into the future as to how benchmarking if adopted as a culture, is poised to fundamentally transform the evolution curve of the e-commerce supply chain. © IEOM Society International.},

abstract={India is rapidly growing in its retail market with the fastest penetration in the field of online retailing. According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), India's internet base which is already the third largest in the world after China and the USA, is growing by nearly 40% YOY. This growth is highlighted by some of its major online retailers like Flipkart, Jabong, Myntra, Snapdeal, and Homeshop 18. Evolution in the consumer market nurtured by demographic shifts, behavioural changes, and consumers' attitudes toward the economy has resulted in the growth of e-tailing which has affected the brick-and-mortar retailers, who are making their recovery and growth at a very low pace. The present exploratory study aims to analyse consumer's preference of shopping in brick and mortar stores vs. online shopping, and how several attributes such as ambience, gratification, experience of touch and feel, etc., are contributing to the benefits of visiting a brick-and-mortar outlet in comparison to an online shopping experience.

abstract={Information retrieval and web search present a Challenging Question to researches. Today users urge for accurate and precise hands on information from Search Machine. Interpreting of user query goal is major challenge in past and present. Numerous algorithms and Frameworks have be proposed, but fail to incorporate user aims, as query without proper intent processing retrieves irrelevant information pattern discovery has ability to solve in limitations of keyword and image disambiguates with phrase learning ie, pattern discovery. Today's search machines are based on ranking model eliminating Boolean retrieval constraint and boosting natural language use. Even though word sense and concept extraction is major challenge which comes up with keywords. Information can be presented in better way with image presentation, which is been used in news portals to communicate fastly happing news and social websites instagram Facebook, flicker.user purchase goods by sighting product images on flipkart. So today uses have sifted their approach from text based information to image based, which has given rise to research domain of image information retrieval (IIR) but large number of image attributes also give rise to Image classification ambiguity. Relevance is major factor that influence information retrieval system performance with impact precision and recall. Relevance re-ranking is methodology opted in to retrieve most optimized relevant results eliminating non-relevant. Large amount of image with associated word annotations are present on different web portals. In this research we build a semantic search engine which selects network design pattern and integrate reinformant learning approach (Agent based learning) that help in selecting information from various networks and help in network structuring with WAIR (Web Agents for Information Retrieval) Architecture at core. Agent helping in retrieving precise objects from different portals and linking them. A optimized procedure E-SimRank is been implemented to count in link semantic in network and content based knowledge learning for reinforcing better results. Performance evaluation show that proposed architecture and algorithm design present faster and relevance result. A image based recommendation system is our research outcome which contributes to image retrieval domain. The research work is been developed by studying 24 core vital articles on image retrieval and find research scope with major challenges which have common ground and need to be addressed. The found Research Analysis Query (RAQ) help in directing to study better techniques to overcome problem. Our research innovation is reinforment learning algorithm agent based system development. Existing state of art of present algorithms have been optimized with this innovation integration. Future scope of research lies to image to image base retrieval or video recommendation system. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={With the recent explosion of e-commerce industry in India, the problem of address geocoding, that is, transforming textual address descriptions to geographic reference, such as latitude, longitude coordinates, has emerged as a core problem for supply chain management. Some of the major areas that rely on precise and accurate address geocoding are supply chain fulfilment, supply chain analytics and logistics. In this paper, we present some of the challenges faced in practice while building an address geocoding engine as a core capability at Flipkart. We discuss the unique challenges of building a geocoding engine for a rapidly developing country like India, such as, fuzzy region boundaries, dynamic topography and lack of convention in spellings of toponyms, to name a few. We motivate the need for building a reliable and precise address geocoding system from a business perspective and argue why some of the commercially available solutions do not suffce for our requirements. SAGEL has evolved through 3 cycles of solution prototypes and pilot experiments. We describe the learnings from each of these phases and how we incorporated them to get to the first production-ready version. We describe how we store and index map data on a SolrCloud cluster of Apache Solr, an open-source search platform, and the core algorithm for geocoding which works post-retrieval in order to determine the best matches among a set of candidate results. We give a brief description of the system architecture and provide accuracy results of our geocoding engine by measuring deviations of geocoded customer addresses across India, from verified latitude, longitude coordinates of those addresses, for a sizeable address set. We also measure and report our system's ability to geocode up to different region levels, like city, locality or building. We compare our results with those of the geocoding service provided by Google against a set of addresses for which we have verified latitude-longitude co-ordinates and show that our geocoding engine is almost as accurate as Google's, while having a higher coverage. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Online shopping in India is growing by leaps and bounds. Improved infrastructure, internet speed and increasing computer literacy are working as an impetus to online shopping. Many firms are entering into this space and making competition intense. Large sharks of the online shopping ocean like Amazon, Flipkart, snapdeal etc., are finding it difficult to deal with the dynamic nature of today's consumer. They are offering huge discounts to the customers, but only offering huge discounts will do no good to retain the customer. As in present era customer is the center of every business, so every organization is striving to gain insights into customer behavior. The most difficult task for online retailers is not to acquire a customer, but to retain the customer. Previous research has advocated the contribution of customers' demographic information in providing insights into online customer behavior. The main aim of this study is to know how demographics impact online purchase frequency. Very little literature is available on studying purchase frequency from a demographic perspective. Using demographic information new customers can be classified into three categories, namely; infrequent shoppers, frequent shoppers and less frequent shoppers. The category 'infrequent shoppers' is comprised of consumers who made three purchases or less in the last 6 months, while the category 'frequent shoppers' consists of consumers who made 7 or more purchases in the same period, less frequent shoppers who made 4-6 purchases in last six months. Decision Trees a relatively new technique in this field is used to classify respondents into above mentioned categories. Many a times a new customer is a prospective frequent customer but lack of interest on the part of organization forces the customer to move to a competitor. Much attention needs to be paid to a prospective frequent customer. This study helps in predicting which customer is most likely to purchase frequently on the basis of demographic factors. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand the behavioral lessons and managerial implications of deep discount strategies used by e-commerce firms to gain a competitive advantage over rivals. The paper seeks to understand the behavioral aspects of consumer and competitor response to such online sales, particularly with reference to e-satisfaction and e-loyalty. The case study seeks to: understand the behavioral aspects of utility and customer satisfaction; understand the behavioral aspects influencing customer attitudes, preferences and choice; understand heuristics involved in consumer decision-making; and understand possible firm strategies based on a thorough analysis of behavioral influencers of customer decisions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a case study approach. Secondary data sources from the library, company website and newspaper articles have been used to build a case which would encourage students to discuss and analyze the application of principles of behavioral economics to marketing problems faced especially by e-retailers. It uses Flipkart’s botched-up Big-Billion Day sale to drive home lessons in behavioral economics to marketers. Findings: With growing internet penetration, e-retail presents high potential in India along with its BRICS peers. However, the task of grabbing customer mindshare, as also a share of wallet of the growing Indian purchasing power through monster discounts and deals by e-tailers may not work. Firms such as Flipkart may strategize using principles of behavioral economics including confirmatory bias, framing effects, reference points, principles of loss aversion, heuristics and the peak–end rule to influence customer decision-making in their favor. They must also guard against any incidents/events which invoke the representativeness heuristic or negative confirmatory biases towards e-commerce portals. Practical implications: E-tailers in countries like India should understand the behavioral implications of deep discount strategies and deals offered by them as a means of gaining competitive advantage. Attention to e-service outcome quality and e-service recovery is important. Originality/value: The case is unique in its applications of behavioral economics principles to e-retailing in India. It seeks to apply behavioral principles to a major e-commerce marketing event in India. With the e-commerce industry likely to boom in India, the case study provides unique insights into competitive pricing strategies adopted by e-retailers and the feasibility thereof. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={E-commerce is on a boom and consumer reviews have become an essential aspect of this growing business. Various models have been proposed that use user feedback reviews to compute seller trust profile. The feedback reviews consist of ratings as well as comments given by the user. Models that compute seller trust based on user feedback ratings overlook the important subjective details in the text and give inaccurate trust scores based on ratings which are objective in nature. We have proposed a novel model for computing seller trust profile based on fine grained analysis of feedback comments. In our approach, we have proposed a unique methodology to compare and verify our result with two e-commerce websites. A few common seller on Amazon and Flipkart have been identified and trust scores have been computed for them. The computed trust scores for the sellers on Amazon are considerably lesser than those displayed on the website while those for Flipkart are nearly equal to those mentioned on its website. The calculated relative error is considerably higher on Amazon as compared to Flipkart. The experiment is unique of its kind in the field of natural language processing and sentiment analysis, and achieves the stated objective. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Given a network with attributed edges, how can we identify anomalous behavior? Networks with edge attributes are ubiquitous, and capture rich information about interactions between nodes. In this paper, we aim to utilize exactly this information to discern suspicious from typical behavior in an unsupervised fashion, lending well to the traditional scarcity of ground-Truth labels in practical anomaly detection scenarios. Our work has a number of notable contributions, including (a) formulation: while most other graph-based anomaly detection works use structural graph connectivity or node information, we focus on the new problem of leveraging edge information, (b) methodology: we introduce EdgeCentric, an intuitive and scalable compression-based approach for detecting edge-Attributed graph anomalies, and (c) practicality: we show that EdgeCentric successfully spots numerous such anomalies in several large, edge-Attributed real-world graphs, including the Flipkart e-commerce graph with over 3 million product reviews between 1.1 million users and 545 thousand products, where it achieved 0.87 precision over the top 100 results. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={With the growth of technology, new products are introduced in the market everyday. This rise in products has initiated competition among different manufacturers. Industries use different strategies to make their products more appealing to the customers and survive in the market. As a result, when launching any new product, it is necessary to analyze the reason behind the success of top competing products in the market having similar properties. This information can be useful for the success of the newly launched product. In view of this challenge, a variance-based product recommendation (VPR) approach is proposed, which aims to find top competitors for any newly launched product having similar description. VPR is based on ratings of a product. Thus, rating by a user is found by combining the user-given rating and the rating predicted from the corresponding review text using lexicon-based sentiment analysis. To implement the approach, the available products are firstly divided into clusters based on description. VPR is then applied on one of the clusters to which the new product belongs to get the top competitors for that product. The approach is verified by conducting tests on a product data set of Amazon reviews obtained from SNAP web data, mashup data from ProgrammableWeb as well as product data from Flipkart. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, most of the business intelligence focus on social media like facebook, twitter, blogs and online commercial websites like shopclues, pepperfry, flipkart, fabfurnish, testfreaks, amazon, greendust etc., to gather comments posted by the buyers in deciding about future demand,brand promotion, market segmentation and product penetration. In turn the buyers were also willing to post their comment about each of the products they buy through online. And these short reviews once refined and analyzed can help us to get a crystal clear opinion about the buyers' view which probably enhances the future buyers to make a buying decision based on spectacular features. This paper includes implementation on data acquisition, preprocessing, combinatory of lexicon and syntactic pattern mining approach (1) to find overall sentiment scores and correlate that score to that of feature score (2) to identify the most promising features of the product. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={E-Commerce is booming in India. A number of industries are emphasizing on it to increase their sales. Fuelled by VC money, E-retailing companies are sacrificing profitability to acquire more consumers. Amazon has already emerged as a leader in terms of visitors followed by Flipkart and SnapDeal. E-retailers are creating superb conducive cyber atmospherics to attract more consumers. The present study attempted to assess the impact of cyber atmospherics on buyer behavior in terms of reliance, contentment, and adhesion. A survey on 300 individuals was conducted for this. Factor analysis on the survey generated interesting insights like emphasis of consumers on reasonable prices ; superb online ambience in terms of design, color, font, size; presence of options; and facilities for feedback sharing through social media. Factor analysis also found that importance is given by consumers to contentment in engaging with an electronic retailer in the long term. The results generated have immense managerial implications as a number of new domestic and international entrants are very eager to have complete knowledge of the pulse of Indian consumers.},

abstract={Abstract: Nowadays it is becoming very critical to find the relevant information in online information system, because it is very huge in various parameters like volume, structure etc., One of the solution to extract the useful information is the recommender system. These recommender system widely used in ecommerce website like Amazon, flipkart, ebay etc.,. The literature of recommender system tells that much work done previously, but user requirements changes day by day, so still there is a necessity of new approaches to extract the useful and meaningful information. For this purpose in this paper, we proposed a recommender system that recommends the user based on their searching location, item and location & item. © International Science Press.},

abstract={Given a heterogeneous network, with nodes of different types - e.g., products, users and sellers from an online recommendation site like Amazon - and labels for a few nodes ('honest', 'suspicious', etc), can we find a closed formula for Belief Propagation (BP), exact or approximate? Can we say whether it will converge? BP, traditionally an inference algorithm for graphical models, exploits so-called "network effects" to perform graph classification tasks when labels for a subset of nodes are provided; and it has been successful in numerous settings like fraudulent entity detection in online retailers and classification in social networks. However, it does not have a closed-form nor does it provide convergence guarantees in general. We propose ZooBP, a method to perform fast BP on undirected heterogeneous graphs with provable convergence guarantees. ZooBP has the following advantages: (1) Generality: It works on heterogeneous graphs with multiple types of nodes and edges; (2) Closed-form solution: ZooBP gives a closed-form solution as well as convergence guarantees; (3) Scalability: ZooBP is linear on the graph size and is up to 600× faster than BP, running on graphs with 3.3 million edges in a few seconds. (4) Effectiveness: Applied on real data (a Flipkart e-commerce network with users, products and sellers), ZooBP identifies fraudulent users with a near-perfect precision of 92.3 % over the top 300 results. © 2017.

abstract={The trend of the online shopping has grown over the recent years, which is clearly visible from the profit statistics posted by the big e-commerce companies in the recent years such as flipkart, snapdeal, etc. The online shopping brutally skips the touch and feel of the products which we generally evaluate as the primary factor during purchasing the commodities from the shops or stores. Assessing the quality of the product also becomes very important, which can be generally discovered by applying the opinion mining techniques over the review data. The product review classification is the mechanism which is used to analyze the sentiment or opinion in the reviews posted by the users in order to prepare the product report. In this paper, the mechanism has been proposed for the opinion mining over the text review data for the generation of the product review report, which is based upon the multiple features altogether. The product report can reveal the several positive and negative points about the specific product, which can play the significant role in the selection of the products on the online portals. The proposed model has been evaluated on the basis of the performance parameters of the precision, recall and polarity based accuracy assessment, which gives the overall perspective about the overall accuracy. The proposed model has been clearly defined better than the existing models, when assessed on the basis of the given parameters. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Alice Mathew, recently bought a T-shirt for her younger son from Snapdeal because it was offering a “better deal”. “The price difference was almost Rs. 100 for the same product on Flipkart.com," says Mathew, an assistant professor at Mount Carmel College, Bangalore. Her rationale: “When I shop online, I look for the best deal and the best product. It doesn’t matter which site I’m shopping from." Her shopping philosophy is hardly unique in the Indian context. The Indian online customer is typically vendor-agnostic and seeks the lowest price for the product of his/her choice. The online marketplace has become a vast hunting ground for the best deals, with multinational and Indian e-commerce giants fighting it out to offer the best prices to lure the fickle deal-seeking Indian customers. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.},

abstract={Review fraud is a pervasive problem in online commerce, in which fraudulent sellers write or purchase fake reviews to manipulate perception of their products and services. Fake reviews are often detected based on several signs, including 1) they occur in short bursts of time; 2) fraudulent user accounts have skewed rating distributions. However, these may both be true in any given dataset. Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach for detecting fraudulent reviews which combines these 2 approaches in a principled manner, allowing successful detection even when one of these signs is not present. To combine these 2 approaches, we formulate our Bayesian Inference for Rating Data (BIRD) model, a flexible Bayesian model of user rating behavior. Based on our model we formulate a likelihood-based suspiciousness metric, Normalized Expected Surprise Total (NEST). We propose a linear-time algorithm for performing Bayesian inference using our model and computing the metric. Experiments on real data show that BIRDNEST successfully spots review fraud in large, real-world graphs: the 50 most suspicious users of the Flipkart platform flagged by our algorithm were investigated and all identified as fraudulent by domain experts at Flipkart.

abstract={Taking into consideration personal innovativeness on information technology, web quality dimension, information and e-service dimension, incentives and post purchase service and online reputation, this research explores how internet shopping malls to establish their competitive advantages through these dimensions. This study starts with an examination of the literature on internet shopping malls about their competitive advantages upon which we develop conceptual framework and proposed a research model. Data is collected through structured questionnaire by survey of experts. TOPSIS is used to rank internet shopping malls and modified TOPSIS is applied to check sensitivity of results. From this study results, information and e-service dimension and online reputation are the most important factors for improving competitive advantage of internet shopping malls. Moreover, Flipkart and Myntra rank the first two positions for internet shopping malls. This study draws on the research results for implications of managerial practice, and then suggests some empirical tactics in order to enhance management performance for the online service providers. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Purpose – This paper aims to focus on the HR issues that seller organizations face during the pre-deal stage of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). It recommends the HR strategies that strategies that seller-side organizations need to adopt to improve their chances of successful M&A. Design/methodology/approach – The paper explores the HR-related issues faced by seller-side organizations. It highlights the key dilemmas and challenges involved at this stage of M&A deals. It recommends the HR strategies that seller companies can follow during the pre-deal stage of an M&A deal. Findings – What the seller’s HR leaders do (and do not do) during the run up to an M&A deal can significantly affect the success of the post-deal integration and future success of the combined firm. During the pre-deal phase of an M&A journey, HR leaders face a range of dilemmas. They have to decide whether to maintain business as usual or change their HR strategy, decide when to hide information and when (and what) to communicate internally and also have to prepare the seller organization for an HR audit by the buyer firm. Practical implicationsHR leaders in seller organizations need to continue to increase the value of the organization by continually aligning the HR strategy to the organization’s overall corporate and business strategy. During the early stages of the deal, they have to camouflage certain confidential details. When the deal is at an advanced stage, HR leaders have to communicate extensively with employees about the deal. They need to ensure that the organization is prepared for an HR audit by prospective buyers. However, they also have to ensure that the reasons for the seller organization’s success are not revealed fully and prematurely. Social implications – It concedes that during an M&A deal, the HR leaders of a seller organization need to balance the interests of multiple stakeholders. These include the firm’s owners, top managers, employees and key customers. Those who are unable to do this effectively and consistently may end up harming the interest of the seller organization during an M&A deal. Originality/value – The paper considers the highly dynamic e-commerce industry in India. It is a sector that is seeing rapid growth. Many new players are entering the market and the battle is for size and scale. In such a scenario, companies such as Flipkart are using the M&A route to scale up inorganically. Recently, Flipkart acquired Myntra, a strong player in the online retailing of fashion garments. The paper provides insights in to the challenges faced by the seller organization’s HR managers during the pre-deal stage of M&A transactions and recommends strategies that they should follow. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Background of the Study: Internet has tremendously changed the face of business arena including e-commerce. Till recent times, ecommerce is confined to only few services like airline tickets, railway tickets, hotel bookings, online mobile recharge etc. Recently E-commerce is emerged into retail and moreover kirana sector also. Objectives of the Study: This paper tries to find the relationship between the age of a person and his or her convenience to buy online and whether there is a relationship between the sex of person and his or her preference to home delivery. This paper also observes the relationship between the perception of quality of products and the type of products they buy. Methods and Analysis: Various data tools are adopted to analyse the data such as Means of the parameters, OnewayAnova and T-test etc appropriately. Sampling is Random Sampling: A sample of 100 is collected. Findings: Many people of the age 20 to 30 are comfortable with buying online. Most of the female customers prefer buying online because they are home delivered. The perception of quality of products effects the buying decision of the products whether it is vegetables, groceries or both. It is also found that the prices in the internet are much cheaper than the prices in local stores. Though we can bargain in the local stores but there are huge discounts and price gap between the stores and the online portals. Applications: E-commerce is trying to consolidate all the suppliers and buyers at a platform to make the market place more comprehensive. Even the big players like Flipkart and Snapdeal are also now encouraging the local kirana players to sell through their web portals. Scope for Further Research: This paper can be further researched on the concepts of mobile e-commerce, e-commerce in food sector, food chains etc.},

abstract={Indian e-retail market has come a long way since inception of leading player, Flipkart, in 2007. The market has tremendous opportunity to grow due to fact that the current penetration of e-retail in overall retail is significantly low and penetration of internet in India is also significantly low. Rising penetration of internet, coupled with increasing use of smartphone, computers will attract the consumers to the online channel. However, price differentiation from traditional retail, offered in the form of discounts by e-retailers will remain the key driver of the growth. Based on a survey it is found that majority of the people will switch back to traditional way of shopping as the look and feel of product is generally not available in online channel despite the benefits provided such as wider portfolio, easy delivery, easy return, convenience, etc. Consumers find discounts and offers as the primary reason for the change in consumer behaviour and shift of channel. On the other hand, the e-retail companies cannot afford to sell the products at heavy discounts as it leads to diseconomies of scale where companies incur heavy investment in logistics and technology and also offer discounts to generate volume. Amidst this, the in-organic style of growth will be an ideal strategy for companies to grow. Growth by mergers and acquisitions (including all forms like forward, backward, or parallel integration) will not only help the company diversify its product portfolio but will also give the companies an upper edge to save on customer acquisition cost, logistic lost, infrastructure development cost, and technology cost. Leading global players like Amazon Inc. adopted a similar strategy to grow in the international market. Amazon Inc. which is one of the leading players in the e-Commerce market acquired 57 companies since 1998 to clock revenue of around USD 89 billion in the year 2014 while its major rival eBay Inc. could reach USD 18 billion in 2014 with 3 acquisitions since 1998. This article covers if a similar paradigm will be seen in the Indian economy too, where the indigenous companies will re-look at their strategies in order to be profitable in the dynamically changing, fastest growing e-Commerce market of India. An early adoption of in-organic growth to scale up operations in the geographically diversified and huge economy like India will only help these players become profitable. Absence of right strategy mix will result in players bleeding and the bubble will eventually burst. © Niraj Satnalika, 2016.},

abstract={Performance testing of a web application is apprehensive with accomplishing response times, throughput, and resourceutilization levels that gather the performance objectives for that applications or websites. Enterprises become assume nowadays, all users with an internet access are a potential customer. Product and service accessibility in the physical location is speedily being replaced by online shopping. Online shopping in India is growing at a very fast manner. At the same time, there is an extreme competition in e-commerce space, especially among top three players namely Flipkart, Snapdeal and Amazon. When online shopping websites announce campaigns, offers, and sales, there is often an uncontrolled rush of buyers to these sites and most often the infrastructure behind these retail websites are not powerful enough to handle the huge volume. In order to evaluate the performance of the retail web applications from each physical location, cloud based performance testing will be the key solution. The performance tests could be run with the load generators by utilizing cloud service providers such as Amazon, Rack space etc. Alternatively, Cloud based performance testing tools could be used for finding the performance of a web application. There is no single tool will be used for all performance measure of a web application. The right choice of testing tools really depends on multiple parameters including customer application architecture, context and customer needs. With this analyzing the importance of the performance of the web application increasing, it is a good idea to evaluate some of the popular open source Performance testing tools. Cloud based software test automation offers Cost Effectiveness, Benefits of Virtualization, More collaboration, Quicker Testing and Reduced IT management effort.},

abstract={Today with the advancement in Internet diversified retrieval is becoming very vast and user want to retrieve the exact information from many e-commerce sites, e. g. Flipkart, Snapdeal and so on. Certain number of times, the queries issued by the user and returned by the search engine is not entirely similar. Many prior works has been conducted in the area of information retrieval, however, optimization and time to retrieve the query still remains a significant challenge to be addressed. In this work, an efficient Pattern Tree-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation (PT-LDA) is designed with the objective of reducing the query retrieval time and therefore improving the query retrieval ratio. The Topic-based Pattern Tree in PT-LDA initially constructs a topic based pattern model using a relevance factor aiming at reducing the query retrieval time. Next, Probability-based Latent Dirichlet Allocation performs an efficient mapping using probability measure aiming at improving the query retrieval ratio. The Pattern Tree-based LDA algorithm in PT-LDA framework efficiently maps the association between user queries and web related documents in a significant manner. The efficiency of PT-LDA framework is measured using the Reuters-21578 Text Categorization Collection Data Set from UCI repository and is shown to be significantly more efficient in terms of query retrieval time, query retrieval ratio and accuracy of results being obtained when compared to the state-of-the-art works. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Social networking sites like Facebook and Flickr allows users to upload billions of images, famous e commerce web sites such as flipkart, amazon etc. are also provides number of product related images to user. Images which are present in social multimedia networking websites are accompanied by different tags, comments, annotations and other related information which tend to form an image rich information networks. Due to existence of different related information to images (tag, annotation etc.) retrieval of images from image rich information networks is very challenging and complex task. In this paper we have proposed an integrated approach (S-Cbir) to retrieve an images from image rich information networks. The proposed algorithm consists integration of two different techniques such as link based image retrieval and content based image retrieval systems. K-Simrank algorithm is first applied to find out the node similarity in image rich information networks and then CBIR technique is applied to find out relevant images. SIFT, CEDD, feature and texture extraction descriptors are used in CBIR technique. The search results shows that proposed algorithm refines the search results and also improves the accuracy of search. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Presently there are various websites like Amazon.com, eBay, FlipKart, Snapdeal etc. which have large number of products available online. The seller or the manufacturer often ask their customers to share their opinions and hands on experiences on the products they have purchased Unfortunately, it is very difficult to go through all customer's reviews and to decide whether the overall performance of the product is satisfactory or not. This paper mainly focuses on the problem of sentiment analysis of customer's online reviews about the product. In this paper we aim to train our system to analyse whether the comment given by the customer is positive or negative. The work is divided in two phases: In first phase, we propose a training process of a Stochastic model namely Hidden Markov Model and secondly we test and reveal the individual comment for analyzing consumer opinions about the products. Our results indicates that the trained system is very promising in performing its tasks and we have achieved maximum possible Precision and Accuracy. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

The market has tremendous opportunity to grow due to fact that the current penetration of e-retail in overall retail is significantly low and penetration of internet in India is also significantly low. Rising penetration of internet, coupled with increasing use of smartphone, computers will attract the consumers to the online channel. However, price differentiation from traditional retail, offered in the form of discounts by e-retailers will remain the key driver of the growth. Based on a survey it is found that majority of the people will switch back to traditional way of shopping as the look and feel of product is generally not available in online channel despite the benefits provided such as wider portfolio, easy delivery, easy return, convenience, etc. Consumers find discounts and offers as the primary reason for the change in consumer behaviour and shift of channel. On the other hand, the e-retail companies cannot afford to sell the products at heavy discounts as it leads to diseconomies of scale where companies incur heavy investment in logistics and technology and also offer discounts to generate volume. Amidst this, the in-organic style of growth will be an ideal strategy for companies to grow. Growth by mergers and acquisitions (including all forms like forward, backward, or parallel integration) will not only help the company diversify its product portfolio but will also give the companies an upper edge to save on customer acquisition cost, logistic lost, infrastructure development cost, and technology cost. Leading global players like Amazon Inc. adopted a similar strategy to grow in the international market. Amazon Inc. which is one of the leading players in the e-Commerce market acquired 57 companies since 1998 to clock revenue of around USD 89 billion in the year 2014 while its major rival eBay Inc. could reach USD 18 billion in 2014 with 3 acquisitions since 1998. This article covers if a similar paradigm will be seen in the Indian economy too, where the indigenous companies will re-look at their strategies in order to be profitable in the dynamically changing, fastest growing e-Commerce market of India. An early adoption of in-organic growth to scale up operations in the geographically diversified and huge economy like India will only help these players become profitable. Absence of right strategy mix will result in players bleeding and the bubble will eventually burst. © 2015 Niraj S, et al.},

abstract={Big data is an ocean of data sets. The revolution of big data can transform the world and business overnight. The data and information can be outsourced to an untrusted cloud while maintaining the velocity and veracity of big data. Big data helps in decision making. It also laid foundation for advancement in science, medicine and Business. Mapreduce and Hadoop frameworks are used to improve the processing speed of data. Can big data really revolutionize our world? This research paper explores how the explosion of information will impact on our lives? This paper illustrates the power of big data. Big data may lead to more accurate analyses. The combination of cloud and Big data is a beginning of a beautiful friendship.. E-commerce companies take advantage of the wide variation in sales tax and local taxes by operating from low geographical regions like Flipkart. Big data analytics can improve efficiency and effectiveness across the broad range of government responsibilities, by improving existing processes and operations and enabling completely new ones. Moreover it is used in the areas of medicine, crime, education and business. It increases the storage capacity, processing power and also risk of security. So big data is not only a volume, it refers as technology. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.},

abstract={Thoughtful insights on business model components of top e-retailers based in India have been achieved through content analysis of reliable books, reports, journals and the web. Six major e-retailers are compared on the basis of monthly traffic data obtained from similarweb.com. It is observed that online retail is a meager 0.5% of overall retail in India and future potential is huge. Due to FDI restrictions all top e-retailers under this study except HS18 prefer marketplace model in pure/hybrid form and earn revenue through transaction fee. Their marketing strategy essentially includes social media and internet. They operate with lean manpower and functional departmentalisation except Flipkart which employs massive 10,000 plus employees and prefers to recruit generalists. National capital region and Bangalore are preferred locations for establishment of their headquarters. This review will be useful to businesses and researchers interested in developing/benchmarking successful e-retail business model to win and sustain competition.

abstract={A large torrent of data is being generated on a daily basis due to many recent technological developments (Web data, Health care, Retail industry, etc.) which cannot be managed by traditional data. So, big data fashion has been increased to capture this humungous amount of data. It has many unique features compared to the traditional data. Data is now not being seen as a by-product of a company/business but as a biggest asset. Data includes insights to customer needs, predicting trends in customer behaviour, regularizing of advertisement to suit varied customer predilection etc. The increase in the pliability and power of smart phones provides more opportunities for rising services to the customer. In the current Business firms, mobile commerce or M-Commerce has entered in retails, telecommunication, finance, services and information technology services. M-Commerce is not only being widely accepted but also it is being more used as a popular way of business/ commerce. This paper provides an overview of the unique features of big data over traditional datasets. In addition to this, the application of big data analytics in the M-Commerce (retail market) and the various technologies that make analytics of consumer data possible is discussed. Further, this paper will also present some case studies of how leading Commerce vendors like Flipkart, Amazon, Walmart Inc, Adidas apply big data analytics in their business strategies. © 2006-2015 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).},

abstract={E-Commerce has already entered into the Indian market for online shopping. People are more inclined towards online shopping which has changed the complete market scenario. There are several online shopping portals offered by organizations such as, Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, Junglee, Jabong, and others, which are enjoying their online market share. As the number of online buyers and traders are increasing, effective business techniques need to be adopted to handle the large amount of data generated every day. Recommendation Systems play an important role in filtering this data and providing adequate information to the users. Various techniques like Collaborative Filtering, Content-based, and Demographic have been adopted for recommendation but there are several drawbacks causing these techniques to fail in providing effective recommendations. Therefore, it is necessary to identify more distinguishing features for optimizing these techniques. This can be achieved through utilizing the strengths of various techniques in a hybrid manner. This paper describes an effective hybrid technique for book recommendation with the use of Ontology for user profiling to increase system efficiency. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The increased use of smartphones and tablets, along with advanced security features being offered by the online retailers are adding strength to e-commerce industry. Growing at an astonishing rate at 85%, as against 65% growth of regular shopping over the previous year, internet retailing in India touched US $10.672 billion in 2013, making it one of the most anticipated destinations for national and multinational online retailers. Several web portals are looking to capture a share of this huge market. This study gains importance as Indian arms of multinational online selling companies like Amazon and eBay are fighting various home-grown players like Snapdeal, Flipkart and many more. The objective of this paper is to identify and rank the factors that influence the selection of web portal among online shoppers in India. Exploratory study was conducted to identify various precursors of web site selection for online shopping. Twenty-four variables identified from this study were used to create a structured questionnaire. This questionnaire was then administered among 203 shoppers in India using convenience sampling. To determine the factors that influence the selection of web portals. Principal Component Analysis with Varimax Rotation was used. The study condensed the comprehensive set of twenty-four variables into six factors that have a direct influence on consumers' choice of online buying website. These were transaction security, augmented benefits, user experience, cognitive stimuli, personalized assurance and web atmospherics. This is against the general perception that shoppers prefer the web portals with best user experience and attractive web atmospherics. The online buying population of the world's third largest economy selects the portals based on the primary motive of security in a transaction. Adding to the existing knowledge on shoppers' selection of online buying portals, the study reveals the prevalence of a multitude of antecedent factors and distinct patterns with respect to constituents of these factors. Findings of this research may be used as guidelines for the development of multi-dimensional strategic framework by online retailing firms. Copyright © 2015, IGI Global.},

abstract={Sentiment analysis mainly focuses on subjectivity and polarity detection. Today consumers make buying decision based on the customer's review that is available in some of the online shopping sites like shopclues, fabfurnish, pepperfry, flipkart etc. There are also some of the specific websites which discuss about positive and negative facts of those products that comes to market like reevoo, buzzillions, bizarte, amazon etc. Hence this type of analysis are socially very needed for sellers to undergo market analysis, branding, product penetration, market segmentation and so on. Here, the proposed paper classifies the most identified features using supervised learning method Na&amp;#x00EF;ve Bayes and determined their positive, negative and neutral polarity distribution. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Now a days, we are living with social media data like heartbeat. The exponential growth with data first presented challenges to cutting-edge businesses such as Google, MSN, Flipkart, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Nevertheless, existing big data analytical models for hadoop comply with MapReduce analytical workloads that process a small segment of the whole data set, thus failing to assess the capabilities of the MapReduce model under heavy workloads that process exponentially accumulative data sizes.[1] In all social business and technical research applications, there is a need to process big data of data in efficient manner on normal uses data. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient technique to classify the big data from e-mail using firefly and naïve bayes classifier. Proposed technique is comprised into two phase, (i) Map reduce framework for training and (ii) Map reduce framework for testing. Initially, the input twitter data is given to the process to select the suitable feature for data classification. The traditional firefly algorithm is applied and the optimized feature space is adopted for the best fitting results. Once the best feature space is identified through firefly algorithm, the data classification is done using the naïve bayes classifier. Here, these two processes are effectively distributed based on the concept given in Map-Reduce framework. The results of the experiment are validated using evaluation metrics namely, computation time, accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. For comparative analysis, proposed big data classification is compared with the existing works of naïve bayes and neural network. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The stories of Kirana shops are now becoming folklore as Digital Retail has reared its head in the Indian sub-continent. To capitalize on this growth there has been a deluge of e-retail portals. However, the demographic scenario and the needs of Indian population are changing rapidly. The current study is an attempt to understand the dynamics of the major factors that consumers look into any of these e-tailers and identify the major dimension that helps in binding the consumers with these portals. For meeting this objective, the top 5 e-retail portals have been selected, based on multiple parameters for evaluating the traffic and importance of a website. These sites are Flipkart, Ebay, SnapDeal, Jabong and Myntra. Subsequently, these websites have been evaluated using the dimensions extended from SERVQUAL. A systematic approach has been taken in evaluating these portals using the theories of Analytic Hierarchy Process for group decision making. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={With the advent of e-commerce in the current market a large number of companies e.g. Flipkart, eBay, infibeam, amazon etc. have come up with a huge range of products on a single platform to the users. These products are recommended to the users based on certain parameters related to the user. Moreover, in order to refine the recommendation these e-commerce based websites have started using social networking sites to access information pertaining to the user in order to improve their recommendation. In this paper we present a novel recommendation system for e-commerce websites using social network knowledge base that uses certain parameters provided by users viz. age group, gender, location etc. and based on these criteria best recommendation is provided by our proposed method using Analytical Hierarchy Process, Merge-and-Sort, and Sort-and-Count algorithms within a wrapper to optimize. User preferences are taken from Facebook whereas Flipkart is chosen as the e-commerce website for illustration of our proposed method. © 2014 IEEE.},
